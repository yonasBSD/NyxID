              NyxID (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, or &quot;the

          <Section title="4. Data Storage & Security">
            <p>
              All data is stored in encrypted MongoDB databases. Sensitive
              fields (OAuth tokens, MFA secrets, API credentials) are encrypted
              with AES-256 at the application layer. Passwords use Argon2id with
              per-user salts.
            </p>
            <p>
              All communications between the app and our servers use TLS 1.2+.
              JWT tokens are signed with RSA-256 keys rotated periodically.

          <Section title="5. Data Sharing">
            <p>
              We do <strong className="text-foreground">not</strong> sell, rent,
              or trade your personal information. We share data only in the
              following cases:

          <Section title="6. Data Retention">
            <p>
              Account data is retained for the lifetime of your account. When
              you delete your account, all personal data is permanently removed
              within 30 days. Audit logs may be retained for up to 90 days for
              security compliance before automatic purging.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="7. Your Rights">
            <p>You have the right to:</p>
            <ul className="list-inside list-disc space-y-1 pl-2">
              <li>Access and export your personal data</li>
              <li>Correct inaccurate information in your profile</li>
              <li>Delete your account and associated data</li>
              <li>Revoke consent for third-party service connections</li>
              <li>Opt out of non-essential communications</li>

              These actions are available through the Settings page in your
              NyxID dashboard, or by contacting us directly.

          </Section>

          <Section title="8. Cookies, Local Storage, and Analytics">
            <p>
              NyxID uses HTTP-only secure cookies for session management and
              browser local storage to persist authentication state.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Telemetry (opt-in).</strong> When you explicitly allow it
              via the consent banner on your first visit (or the toggle in
              Settings), NyxID collects anonymous usage events (pageviews,
              clicks, uncaught errors) through a third-party analytics
              provider (PostHog, US region). No credentials, form content,
              tokens, or the body of any request you make are ever captured.
              Sensitive URL segments (reset tokens, OAuth callback codes,
              approval IDs) are dropped at the egress layer before any event
              leaves your browser.
              {/* TODO(legal): document EU→US transfer basis (SCCs / adequacy)
                  here before broader EU launch. Tracked in
                  docs/TELEMETRY_CONSENT_FIX.md §9.2. */}
            </p>
            <p>
              Events are keyed to your NyxID account UUID after you sign in,
              allowing us to understand how our product is used in aggregate
              without requiring your name or email. Raw events are retained
              for 90 days; aggregated metrics may be retained longer. If you
              delete your NyxID account, the backend enqueues a matching
              delete request to the analytics provider so that your event
              history is removed.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can change your telemetry choice at any time from the
              Settings page. We honor the browser Do-Not-Track signal.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Per-device scope.</strong> Your telemetry choice is
              stored on this browser and does not sync across the web
              dashboard, mobile app, and CLI. Each surface manages its own
              telemetry setting — the CLI uses{" "}
              <code>nyxid telemetry enable|disable</code> or the{" "}
              <code>DO_NOT_TRACK=1</code> environment variable, and the
              mobile app exposes a matching toggle in its own Settings
              screen.

              knowingly collect personal information from children. If you
