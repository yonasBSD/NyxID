// OAuth and device-code sub-flows for the ai-key pairing panel.
//
// Ported from cli/src/wizard/assets/wizard.js::runOauthFlow and
// runDeviceCodeFlow. Same contract, different transport: whereas the
// local-server wizard runs on 127.0.0.1 and proxies backend calls
// through its own axum process, the pair page runs on the regular
// NyxID origin and calls the backend directly via the cookie-auth
// `api` client.
//
// Both flows follow the same three-stage shape:
//   1. POST /keys → placeholder UserService with status=pending_auth
//   2. Initiate provider auth (popup for OAuth / user code + URL for
//      device) and wait for the provider side to grant access
//   3. GET /keys/{id} to read the now-active key, hand the summary
//      to `onSuccess`, and let the parent fire the pairing ack
//
// The parent passes `providerId`, `slug`, and `label`; these flows
// own the rest — placeholder creation, polling, and cleanup.
