# NyxID

**NyxID** is a self-hosted authentication and single sign-on (SSO) platform. Named after Nyx, the Greek goddess and protector of darkness, NyxID guards the boundary between your users and your services.

It provides a complete identity layer: user registration, session management, OpenID Connect, social login, multi-factor authentication, API key management, a reverse proxy that injects credentials into downstream service requests, a mobile approval app (iOS + Android), and a TypeScript OAuth SDK for client integration.

## Features

### Authentication and Session Management
- Email/password registration with Argon2id hashing (OWASP-recommended parameters)
- Session-based authentication with HttpOnly, SameSite cookies
- JWT access and refresh tokens signed with RS256 (4096-bit RSA keys)
- Token rotation on refresh for replay attack prevention

### OpenID Connect Provider
- Full Authorization Code flow with mandatory PKCE (S256)
- ID token issuance following OpenID Connect Core
- UserInfo endpoint
- Support for both confidential and public clients

### Social Login
- Google and GitHub OAuth 2.0 integration
- Automatic account linking by verified email
- Session creation on successful social login (same cookies as email/password login)

### Social Token Exchange (Native Mobile)
- Exchange external provider tokens (Google ID tokens, GitHub access tokens) for NyxID token sets via RFC 8693 Token Exchange
- Enables native mobile apps (Google Sign-In SDK, GitHub OAuth) to authenticate without browser redirects
- Google ID tokens verified cryptographically via JWKS (RS256 signature, audience, expiry, email verification)
- GitHub access tokens verified as app-bound to NyxID's configured GitHub OAuth app, then validated via GitHub API
- Same account linking rules as web social login: returning user, email linking, or new user creation
- Reuses the existing `POST /oauth/token` endpoint -- no new routes or environment variables required
- JWKS keys cached with TTL to minimize external network calls
- Supports both confidential and public OAuth clients (mobile apps can omit `client_secret`)

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- TOTP-based second factor (compatible with Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password)
- QR code provisioning
- Recovery codes for account recovery
- MFA secrets encrypted at rest

### API Key Management
- Create, list, rotate, and revoke scoped API keys
- Key prefix display for identification (full key shown only at creation)
- SHA-256 hashed storage (plaintext never persisted)
- Optional expiration dates
- Last-used tracking

### Downstream Service Proxy
- Reverse proxy to internal or external services
- Three service categories: **provider** (OIDC/SSO), **connection** (per-user credentials), **internal** (master credential)
- Automatic credential injection: header, bearer token, query parameter, or basic auth
- Developer-friendly slug-based proxy URLs (`/api/v1/proxy/s/{slug}/{path}`) alongside UUID-based URLs
- Service discovery endpoint (`GET /api/v1/proxy/services`) for listing available services with proxy URLs and connection status
- Downstream docs catalog: discover per-service Scalar, OpenAPI, and AsyncAPI URLs from `GET /api/v1/proxy/services`
- Connection enforcement: users must connect before proxying; per-user credentials for connection services, master credentials for internal services
- SSRF protection (blocks private IPs, metadata endpoints, localhost)
- Path traversal prevention (rejects `..` and `//` in proxy paths)
- Header allowlist to prevent leaking sensitive request headers

### API Documentation and Discovery
- Built-in OpenAPI 3.1 generation for NyxID's own REST API
- Built-in AsyncAPI 3.0 generation for NyxID's WebSocket and SSE transports
- Authenticated Scalar UI at `GET /api/v1/docs`
- Unified API catalog at `GET /api/v1/docs/catalog` for NyxID-managed downstream services
- Automatic downstream spec discovery from common OpenAPI and AsyncAPI well-known paths
- Proxy-aware spec rewriting so "Try it" calls route back through NyxID's authenticated proxy
- Streaming capability detection surfaced via service metadata and the catalog UI

### SSH Tunneling
- Authenticated SSH-over-WebSocket tunnel at `GET /api/v1/ssh/{service_id}`
- First-class SSH services created with `service_type: "ssh"` and embedded `ssh_config`
- Short-lived OpenSSH user certificates signed by a NyxID-managed per-service CA
- Built-in `nyxid ssh` helper for certificate issuance, ProxyCommand tunneling, and config generation
- Per-user concurrent SSH session limiting with audit logs for connect, disconnect, duration, and byte counts
- Optional node-routed SSH transport so the same credential node topology can bridge raw SSH TCP sessions

### Service Connection Management
- Register downstream services with encrypted credentials (AES-256-GCM)
- Per-user encrypted credential storage for connection services
- Credential update without disconnect/reconnect
- Secure credential cleanup on disconnect and service deactivation
- Single source of truth for mapping users to downstream APIs

### Administration
- Full admin user management: list, view, edit, delete users
- Role management: promote/demote admin privileges (with self-protection)
- Account control: enable/disable users with automatic session and API key revocation
- Force password reset with session revocation
- Manual email verification
- Per-user session listing and bulk session revocation
- Cascade user deletion across 8 related collections (audit logs preserved)
- Audit log with action, resource, IP, and user-agent tracking (filterable by user)
- OAuth client management (create, list, deactivate)

### Roles and Groups (RBAC)
- Role definitions with permission string tags (e.g., `users:read`, `users:write`)
- Realm-level and client-scoped roles
- System roles (`admin`, `user`) seeded at startup and protected from deletion
- Default roles auto-assigned to new users
- Groups with role inheritance: all group members inherit the group's roles
- Hierarchical groups with optional parent-child relationships
- Direct role assignment to users and indirect assignment via group membership
- Effective permissions computed from direct roles + group-inherited roles
- New scopes (`roles`, `groups`) control whether RBAC claims appear in tokens
- Admin CRUD for roles, groups, role assignment, and group membership

### Token Introspection and Revocation
- Token introspection endpoint (RFC 7662): validates access and refresh tokens, returns active status with claims
- Token revocation endpoint (RFC 7009): revokes refresh tokens; access tokens expire naturally
- Both endpoints require client authentication (`client_id` + `client_secret`)
- Introspection response includes RBAC claims (`roles`, `groups`, `permissions`) when present

### User Consent Management
- Users can view all OAuth consents granted to third-party applications
- Per-client consent revocation without disconnecting from the application
- Consent records track granted scopes, grant time, and optional expiration

### Service Accounts
- Non-human (machine-to-machine) identities for programmatic access
- OAuth2 Client Credentials Grant authentication (`POST /oauth/token` with `grant_type=client_credentials`)
- Admin CRUD for service accounts with paginated listing and search
- Client secret generation with SHA-256 hashed storage (plaintext shown once at creation)
- Client secret rotation with automatic token revocation
- Scope-based access control (requested scopes must be a subset of allowed scopes)
- Token revocation support with per-token tracking via JTI
- Service accounts can access proxy, LLM gateway, connections, and provider endpoints
- RBAC role assignment for service accounts (direct roles, no group membership)
- Blocked from human-only endpoints (auth, users, sessions, admin, MFA)
- Configurable token TTL (default: 1 hour)
- Full audit logging for all service account operations

### Credential Broker
- 19 providers auto-seeded at startup: 7 API key providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, Mistral, Cohere, DeepSeek, OpenAI Codex) and 11 social OAuth2 providers (Google, GitHub, Twitter/X, Facebook, Discord, Spotify, LinkedIn, Slack, Microsoft, TikTok, Twitch) plus Reddit
- Three credential modes: admin-managed (`admin`), user-provided (`user`), or both -- users can bring their own OAuth app credentials for supported providers
- Users connect by entering API keys or completing OAuth2/device-code flows
- All credentials encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM) with secure memory cleanup (zeroize)
- Token revocation on disconnect: best-effort remote revocation via provider's revocation endpoint (RFC 7009)
- Credential delegation: downstream services declare provider requirements, proxy injects user tokens automatically
- Lazy OAuth token refresh with 5-minute buffer before expiry
- Token lifecycle tracking: active, expired, revoked, refresh_failed

### LLM Gateway
- Unified LLM access through NyxID: proxy requests to any supported LLM provider using stored credentials
- **Provider-specific endpoint:** `ANY /api/v1/llm/{provider_slug}/v1/{*path}` -- passthrough proxy to a specific provider's API
- **OpenAI-compatible gateway:** `ANY /api/v1/llm/gateway/v1/{*path}` -- routes requests by `model` field and translates between API formats
- **Status endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/llm/status` -- per-user provider readiness with proxy URLs
- Auto-seeded downstream services for 7 LLM providers at startup (no manual configuration required)
- Model-to-provider routing based on model name prefix (e.g., `gpt-*` to OpenAI, `claude-*` to Anthropic)
- Automatic Anthropic format translation: send OpenAI-format requests to Claude models through the gateway
- Google AI routed through its OpenAI-compatible endpoint automatically
- Supported providers: OpenAI, OpenAI Codex (OAuth), Anthropic, Google AI, Mistral, Cohere, DeepSeek

### Identity Propagation
- Forward authenticated user identity to downstream services during proxy requests
- Four modes: `none`, `headers`, `jwt`, `both`
- Header mode: `X-NyxID-User-Id`, `X-NyxID-User-Email`, `X-NyxID-User-Name`
- JWT mode: Short-lived RS256-signed identity assertion (60-second TTL) via `X-NyxID-Identity-Token`
- Per-service configuration of which claims to include
- CRLF injection prevention on all header values

### Delegated Access
- Downstream services can make NyxID API calls (LLM gateway, proxy) on behalf of users
- Two complementary paths:
  - **MCP Injection:** NyxID automatically injects a short-lived delegation token (`X-NyxID-Delegation-Token`, 5-min TTL) when proxying MCP tool calls to services with `inject_delegation_token` enabled
  - **OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange (RFC 8693):** OIDC-linked services exchange a user's access token for a delegated token (5-minute TTL) via `POST /oauth/token` with `grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange`
  - **Token Refresh:** Downstream services can renew delegation tokens during long-running/agentic workflows via `POST /api/v1/delegation/refresh`
- Delegated tokens are standard NyxID JWTs with `act.sub` (acting service) and `delegated: true` claims
- Scope enforcement: delegated tokens are restricted to proxy, LLM gateway, and delegation refresh endpoints; all other endpoints reject them via middleware
- Consent-gated: token exchange and every refresh validate that the user has active consent for the client; revoking consent immediately blocks further delegation
- Chained exchange prevention: delegated tokens cannot be exchanged for new delegated tokens
- Per-client `delegation_scopes` configuration controls which scopes can be requested
- Per-service `inject_delegation_token` and `delegation_token_scope` control MCP/proxy injection

### Transaction Approval
- Push-based approval for service access via Telegram and mobile push notifications (FCM + APNs)
- **Blocking flow:** Proxy and LLM gateway requests hold the HTTP connection open until the user approves/rejects or the timeout expires, then return the downstream response or a 403 error -- no retry needed
- Triggered for **all non-session auth methods** (API keys, delegated tokens, service accounts, access tokens) when the resource owner has approval enabled
- **Per-service approval configuration:** Override the global approval toggle on a per-service basis (e.g., require approval for OpenAI but auto-approve internal services). 3-tier resolution: per-service config -> global setting -> default (no approval)
- Configurable approval timeout (10--300 seconds) and grant expiry (1--365 days)
- Approval grants: once approved, access is granted for a configurable period without re-prompting
- Web UI and Telegram approval: approve or reject from the NyxID dashboard or directly in Telegram
- **Dual Telegram delivery:** Webhook mode for production (public HTTPS URL required) or automatic long polling fallback for development (no ngrok needed)
- Approval history and grant management pages in the frontend
- Idempotent approval requests (SHA-256 based idempotency keys prevent duplicates)
- Approval status polling endpoint for programmatic callers
- Background task auto-expires timed-out requests

### Credential Nodes (Node Proxy)
- Run lightweight credential nodes on your own infrastructure via the `nyxid-node` agent binary
- Credentials never transit NyxID -- the node injects them locally before forwarding to the downstream service
- Selective per-service routing: bind specific services to a node, keep others on NyxID
- Automatic fallback to NyxID-stored credentials when a node is offline
- Streaming proxy support: SSE/chunked responses streamed through the WebSocket tunnel in real time
- Node-routed SSH support: the same WebSocket control plane can bridge raw SSH TCP sessions for bound services
- Multi-node failover: priority-based routing with health-aware automatic failback
- HMAC request signing: HMAC-SHA256 integrity verification with replay protection
- Per-node metrics: request counts, success rate, average latency, error tracking
- Admin management: system-wide node view with disconnect and delete actions
- WebSocket-based control plane with heartbeat health monitoring
- One-time registration tokens with configurable TTL
- Auth token and signing secret rotation with immediate invalidation
- Configurable limits: max nodes per user, max concurrent connections, proxy timeout

See [docs/NYXID_NODE.md](docs/NYXID_NODE.md) for the agent user guide, [docs/NODE_PROXY.md](docs/NODE_PROXY.md) for setup instructions, and [docs/NODE_PROXY_PROTOCOL.md](docs/NODE_PROXY_PROTOCOL.md) for the WebSocket protocol specification.

### Security Hardening
- Rate limiting: per-IP sliding window with global token-bucket fallback
- Security headers: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options (DENY), X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy
- CORS restricted to a single configured frontend origin
- 1 MB global body size limit
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Structured error responses that never leak internal details
- Audit logging for all authentication events

### Mobile App (iOS + Android)
- React Native + Expo cross-platform mobile app for transaction approvals
- Challenge inbox: view, approve, and reject pending approval requests
- Push notifications via APNs (iOS) and FCM (Android)
- Deep linking: `nyxid://challenge/{id}` opens approval detail directly
- Secure token storage via `expo-secure-store`
- Approval grant management with revocation
- EAS cloud builds for TestFlight and Play Store distribution

### OAuth SDK (`@nyxids/*`)
- TypeScript OAuth 2.0 client SDK for integrating with NyxID
- `@nyxids/oauth-core`: PKCE Authorization Code flow, token management, userinfo endpoint
- `@nyxids/oauth-react`: React context provider + `useNyxID()` hook
- Storage-agnostic: works with `localStorage` (browser) or custom backends
- Zero runtime dependencies in the core package

## Prerequisites

| Tool       | Version   | Purpose                              |
|------------|-----------|--------------------------------------|
| Rust       | 1.85+     | Backend compiler                     |
| Node.js    | 20+       | Frontend build tooling               |
| MongoDB    | 8.0       | Primary database                     |
| Docker     | 24+       | Run MongoDB and Mailpit via Compose  |

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChronoAIProject/NyxID.git
cd NyxID

cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and generate a real encryption key:

```bash
# Generate a 32-byte encryption key (required)
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Paste the output as the value of `ENCRYPTION_KEY` in `.env`.

### 2. Start infrastructure

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts:
- **MongoDB 8.0** on port `27017` (database: `nyxid`)
- **Mailpit** SMTP on port `1025`, web UI on port `8025` (for dev email testing)

### 3. Initialize database

MongoDB collections are created automatically on first use. No manual migrations are required.

### 4. Start the backend

```bash
cargo run --manifest-path backend/Cargo.toml
```

The server starts on `http://localhost:3001`. RSA signing keys are auto-generated in development mode if the `keys/` directory does not exist.

### 5. Start the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend starts on `http://localhost:3000`.

### 6. Verify

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "version": "0.1.0"
}
```

---

## API Documentation

All endpoints return JSON. Authenticated endpoints require either:
- A `Bearer <token>` header, or
- A valid `nyx_session` cookie for first-party browser sessions

NyxID also serves authenticated interactive docs and a downstream docs catalog:
- `GET /api/v1/docs` -- Scalar UI for NyxID's OpenAPI 3.1 spec
- `GET /api/v1/docs/openapi.json` -- Raw NyxID OpenAPI 3.1 document
- `GET /api/v1/docs/asyncapi.json` -- Raw AsyncAPI 3.0 document for WebSocket and SSE transports
- `GET /api/v1/docs/catalog` -- Unified catalog of downstream docs and streaming capabilities
- `GET /api/v1/proxy/services/{service_id}/docs` -- Scalar UI for a downstream service
- `GET /api/v1/proxy/services/{service_id}/openapi.json` -- Proxied downstream OpenAPI document
- `GET /api/v1/proxy/services/{service_id}/asyncapi.json` -- Proxied downstream AsyncAPI document

For the interactive API discovery workflow, see **[docs/API_DISCOVERY.md](docs/API_DISCOVERY.md)**.
For SSH usage and ProxyCommand examples, see **[docs/SSH_TUNNELING.md](docs/SSH_TUNNELING.md)**.

## Environment Variables

All configuration is loaded from environment variables. A `.env` file is supported via `dotenvy`.

### Required

| Variable         | Description                                        | Example                                        |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `DATABASE_URL`   | MongoDB connection string                          | `mongodb://localhost:27017/nyxid`              |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | 32-byte hex-encoded AES-256 key (64 hex chars)     | Output of `openssl rand -hex 32`               |

### Encryption

| Variable                   | Default | Description                                                          |
|----------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY_PREVIOUS`  | *(none)* | Previous encryption key for zero-downtime key rotation (64 hex chars). Set this to the old `ENCRYPTION_KEY` value when rotating keys. With Phase 2 envelope encryption, KEK rotation only re-wraps per-record DEK blobs (via `rewrap()`) without re-encrypting data. One previous key supported at a time; finish re-wrapping before rotating again. See [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md#key-rotation) for the full procedure and `/health` decrypt counters. |

### Server

| Variable       | Default                  | Description                          |
|----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `PORT`         | `3001`                   | HTTP listen port                     |
| `BASE_URL`     | `http://localhost:3001`  | Backend base URL (used in JWT `aud`) |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | `http://localhost:3000`  | Frontend origin for CORS             |
| `ENVIRONMENT`  | `development`            | `development`, `staging`, `production` |

### Database

| Variable                   | Default | Description                     |
|----------------------------|---------|---------------------------------|
| `DATABASE_MAX_CONNECTIONS` | `10`    | Connection pool max size        |

### JWT

| Variable               | Default              | Description                              |
|------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` | `keys/private.pem`   | Path to RSA private key PEM file         |
| `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH`  | `keys/public.pem`    | Path to RSA public key PEM file          |
| `JWT_ISSUER`           | `nyxid`              | JWT `iss` claim value                    |
| `JWT_ACCESS_TTL_SECS`  | `900` (15 min)       | Access token lifetime in seconds         |
| `JWT_REFRESH_TTL_SECS` | `604800` (7 days)    | Refresh token lifetime in seconds        |
| `SA_TOKEN_TTL_SECS`   | `3600` (1 hour)      | Service account token lifetime in seconds |

In development mode, RSA keys are auto-generated if the files do not exist. In production, you must provide pre-generated keys:

```bash
openssl genrsa -out keys/private.pem 4096
openssl rsa -in keys/private.pem -pubout -out keys/public.pem
chmod 600 keys/private.pem
```

### Rate Limiting

| Variable               | Default | Description                            |
|------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------|
| `RATE_LIMIT_PER_SECOND`| `10`    | Global rate limit (requests/second)    |
| `RATE_LIMIT_BURST`     | `30`    | Burst capacity and per-IP limit        |

### Social Login (Optional)

| Variable               | Description             |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`     | Google OAuth client ID  |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google OAuth secret     |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`     | GitHub OAuth client ID  |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | GitHub OAuth secret     |

### Telegram / Approval System (Optional)

| Variable                         | Default | Description                                      |
|----------------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`             |         | Telegram Bot API token (from @BotFather)         |
| `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET`        |         | Secret for verifying Telegram webhook callbacks  |
| `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL`           |         | Public URL for Telegram webhooks (e.g. `https://auth.nyxid.dev/api/v1/webhooks/telegram`). Omit to use long polling mode. |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME`          |         | Bot username without @ (for link instructions)   |
| `APPROVAL_EXPIRY_INTERVAL_SECS`  | `5`     | Interval between approval expiry sweeps (seconds)|

The approval system works without Telegram -- users can always approve/reject via the web UI. Telegram delivery requires `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`.

### Mobile Push Notifications (Optional)

| Variable                         | Default | Description                                          |
|----------------------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `FCM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH`       |         | Path to Firebase service account JSON file           |
| `APNS_KEY_PATH`                  |         | Path to APNs .p8 private key file                    |
| `APNS_KEY_ID`                    |         | APNs Key ID (from Apple Developer portal)            |
| `APNS_TEAM_ID`                   |         | APNs Team ID (from Apple Developer portal)           |
| `APNS_TOPIC`                     |         | APNs topic / iOS app bundle ID (e.g. `dev.nyxid.app`)|
| `APNS_SANDBOX`                   | `true` in dev, `false` in prod | Use APNs sandbox environment |

FCM and APNs are independent -- configure either or both. Push notifications are sent in parallel alongside Telegram. Invalid device tokens are automatically cleaned up when the push service reports them as unregistered.

**Telegram delivery modes:** When `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL` (and `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET`) are set, the backend registers a webhook with Telegram at startup. When only `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is set (no webhook URL), the backend automatically falls back to `getUpdates` long polling -- ideal for local development without ngrok or tunnels.

### SMTP (Optional)

| Variable            | Description                       |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `SMTP_HOST`         | SMTP server hostname              |
| `SMTP_PORT`         | SMTP server port                  |
| `SMTP_USERNAME`     | SMTP authentication username      |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD`     | SMTP authentication password      |
| `SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS` | Sender address for outbound email |

For development, Mailpit is provided via Docker Compose (SMTP on `localhost:1025`, web UI at `http://localhost:8025`).

### Credential Nodes (Optional)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `NODE_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECS` | `30` | Heartbeat ping interval to connected nodes |

## Security

### Cryptography

| Purpose              | Algorithm / Standard                           |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Password hashing     | Argon2id (m=64MiB, t=3, p=4)                  |
| JWT signing          | RS256 with 4096-bit RSA keys                   |
| Encryption at rest   | AES-256-GCM envelope encryption (per-record DEKs wrapped by KEK) |
| Token hashing        | SHA-256                                         |
| PKCE                 | S256 (SHA-256 code challenge)                   |

### HTTP Security Headers

Every response includes:
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), interest-cohort=()`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`

### Cookie Security

- Browser authentication uses an `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax` `nyx_session` cookie
- `Secure` flag is automatically set when not running on localhost
- Mobile and OAuth clients use bearer tokens and refresh tokens in explicit request bodies instead of browser auth cookies

### SSRF Protection

The service registration endpoint validates that `base_url` values:
- Use `https://` or `http://` scheme only
- Do not resolve to private IP ranges (10.x, 172.16-31.x, 192.168.x, 127.x, ::1)
- Do not point to `localhost`, `metadata.google.internal`, or other reserved hosts

### Rate Limiting

Dual-layer rate limiting:
1. **Per-IP**: Sliding window counter per client IP (configurable via `RATE_LIMIT_BURST`)
2. **Global**: Token-bucket algorithm as a safety net for total server throughput

Returns HTTP 429 when limits are exceeded.

## Credential Nodes (Node Proxy)

NyxID supports user-operated **credential nodes** that keep API keys and tokens on your own infrastructure. When a proxy request arrives for a node-bound service, NyxID routes it to your node via WebSocket. The node injects credentials locally and forwards to the downstream service. Credentials never transit NyxID's servers.

**Key features:**
- **Selective routing:** Bind specific services to a node; unbound services use NyxID-stored credentials
- **Automatic fallback:** If the node is offline, requests transparently fall back to the standard proxy
- **Streaming proxy:** SSE/chunked responses streamed through the WebSocket tunnel in real time
- **Multi-node failover:** Priority-based routing with health-aware node selection
- **HMAC request signing:** HMAC-SHA256 integrity verification with replay protection
- **Per-node metrics:** Request counts, success rate, latency tracking, error diagnostics
- **Admin management:** System-wide node view with disconnect/delete actions
- **WebSocket control plane:** Persistent connection with heartbeat monitoring (configurable interval and timeout)
- **Token security:** Registration and auth tokens are 32-byte random values; only SHA-256 hashes are stored
- **Audit trail:** All node operations and node-routed proxy requests are logged

**Quick start:**
1. Build the agent: `cargo build --release -p nyxid-node`
2. Navigate to **Credential Nodes** in the dashboard and click **Register Node**
3. Register the agent: `nyxid-node register --token nyx_nreg_... --url wss://your-server/api/v1/nodes/ws`
   - Add `--keychain` to store secrets in the OS keychain instead of encrypted file
4. Add credentials: `nyxid-node credentials add --service openai --header "Authorization: Bearer sk-..."`
5. Start the agent: `nyxid-node start`
6. Bind services to the node from the node detail page
7. (Optional) Migrate storage: `nyxid-node migrate --to keychain`

For the agent user guide, see **[docs/NYXID_NODE.md](docs/NYXID_NODE.md)**.
For setup instructions, see **[docs/NODE_PROXY.md](docs/NODE_PROXY.md)**.
For the WebSocket protocol specification, see **[docs/NODE_PROXY_PROTOCOL.md](docs/NODE_PROXY_PROTOCOL.md)**.

## MCP Integration

NyxID is designed to be accessible to AI agents via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The backend's built-in MCP transport (`/mcp`) exposes connected downstream services as MCP tools.

**How it works:**
- MCP sessions start with 3 meta-tools: `nyx__search_tools`, `nyx__discover_services`, and `nyx__connect_service`
- Service tools are loaded on-demand when the LLM calls `nyx__search_tools` or `nyx__connect_service`
- The server sends `notifications/tools/list_changed` so clients automatically refresh their tool lists
- Each service endpoint is mapped to an MCP tool named `{service_slug}__{endpoint_name}`
- Tool calls are forwarded through NyxID's authenticated proxy with per-user credential injection
- Maximum 20 activated services per session to bound memory usage

**Agent capabilities:**
- Authenticate users and manage sessions
- Create and rotate API keys
- Register and query downstream services
- Proxy requests to downstream services on behalf of users
- Query audit logs

This makes NyxID suitable as an identity and credential management layer in agentic workflows. See **[docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)** for MCP proxy deployment instructions.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions. See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for the development workflow, coding conventions, and pull request process.

## Development Guide

### Running Tests

```bash
# Backend unit tests
cargo test --manifest-path backend/Cargo.toml

# Frontend lint
cd frontend && npm run lint
```

### Code Organization

The backend follows a strict layered architecture:

- **`handlers/`** -- HTTP request/response logic only. No business logic.
- **`services/`** -- Business logic. No HTTP types.
- **`models/`** -- MongoDB document structs (serde). No logic.
- **`crypto/`** -- Cryptographic operations. Pure functions where possible.
- **`mw/`** -- Axum middleware (auth extraction, rate limiting, security headers).
- **`errors/`** -- Centralized error types with HTTP status code mapping.

### Adding a New Endpoint

1. Define request/response types in `handlers/<module>.rs`
2. Implement business logic in `services/<module>.rs`
3. Register the route in `routes.rs`
4. Add audit logging where appropriate

### Frontend Development

The frontend uses:
- **React 19** with function components and hooks
- **TanStack Router** for type-safe file-based routing
- **TanStack Query** for server state management
- **Zustand** for client-side auth state
- **shadcn/ui** (Radix primitives + Tailwind CSS v4) for the component library
- **Zod v4** for runtime schema validation
- **React Hook Form** with Zod resolvers for form handling

### Production Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Set `ENVIRONMENT=production`
- [ ] Generate and mount RSA key pair (`keys/private.pem`, `keys/public.pem`)
- [ ] Generate a secure `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (`openssl rand -hex 32`)
- [ ] Configure a real `DATABASE_URL` with SSL
- [ ] Set `BASE_URL` and `FRONTEND_URL` to production origins
- [ ] Configure social login provider credentials if needed
- [ ] Configure SMTP for transactional email
- [ ] Configure Telegram bot for approval notifications (optional: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL`)
- [ ] Configure FCM for mobile push (optional: generate Firebase service account JSON, set `FCM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH`)
- [ ] Configure APNs for mobile push (optional: obtain .p8 key from Apple Developer, set `APNS_KEY_PATH`, `APNS_KEY_ID`, `APNS_TEAM_ID`, `APNS_TOPIC`, `APNS_SANDBOX=false`)
- [ ] Place behind a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy) that sets `X-Forwarded-For`
- [ ] Enable TLS termination at the reverse proxy
- [ ] Set `RUST_LOG=nyxid=info,tower_http=warn` for production log levels
