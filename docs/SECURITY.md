## Encryption at Rest

### Algorithm

All sensitive data is encrypted using **AES-256-GCM** (Galois/Counter Mode):

- **Key size:** 256 bits (32 bytes), provided via `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable (64 hex characters)
- **Nonce:** Random 96-bit (12-byte) nonce generated per encryption operation via `OsRng`
- **Authentication:** GCM provides authenticated encryption -- tampering is detected on decryption

### Ciphertext Formats

NyxID supports three ciphertext formats. All new encryptions use v2 (envelope encryption). Decryption transparently handles all formats via a fallback chain.

**v0 (legacy):**

```
nonce(12) || ciphertext || tag(16)
```

**v1 (Phase 1):**

```
0x01 || key_id(1) || nonce(12) || ciphertext || tag(16)
```

- `0x01` -- version byte
- `key_id` -- a stable 1-byte identifier derived from `SHA-256(key)[0]`
- NyxID also accepts the earlier draft Phase 1 header (`0x00` / `0x01`) for local backward compatibility during rollout

**v2 (current -- envelope encryption):**

```
0x02 || kek_id(1) || wrapped_dek_len(2 BE) || wrapped_dek(60) || data_nonce(12) || data_ciphertext || data_tag(16)
```

- `0x02` -- version byte for envelope encryption
- `kek_id` -- stable 1-byte identifier of the KEK that wrapped the DEK, derived from `SHA-256(kek)[0]`
- `wrapped_dek_len` -- big-endian u16, length of the wrapped DEK blob (currently always 60)
- `wrapped_dek` -- `dek_nonce(12) || encrypted_dek(32) || dek_tag(16)` -- the per-record DEK encrypted with the KEK
- `data_nonce` -- random 12-byte nonce for data encryption (separate from the DEK-wrapping nonce)
- `data_ciphertext || data_tag` -- the actual credential encrypted with the per-record DEK

Each v2 encryption generates a fresh random 32-byte DEK that is used once and immediately zeroized. The KEK never directly touches plaintext data.

### Decrypt Fallback Chain

When decrypting, the system tries formats and keys in this order:

1. If data looks like v2 (len >= 92 and byte 0 == `0x02`): unwrap DEK with current KEK, decrypt data with DEK
2. If v2 and `kek_id` matches the previous KEK: unwrap DEK with previous KEK, decrypt data with DEK
3. If data looks like v1 (len >= 30 and byte 0 == `0x01`) and `key_id` matches current key: try v1 payload with current key
4. If v1 and `key_id` matches previous key: try v1 payload with previous key
5. If v1 uses the draft Phase 1 header (`0x00` / `0x01`): try current key, then previous key for compatibility
6. Try v0 (full data as `nonce || ciphertext || tag`) with current key
7. Try v0 with previous key
8. Return error if all attempts fail

Error messages do not reveal which key was tried or which format was detected.

### Rewrap Capability

The `rewrap()` method enables efficient KEK rotation for v2 ciphertexts without full re-encryption:

1. Unwraps the per-record DEK with the previous KEK
2. Re-wraps the DEK with the current KEK using a fresh random nonce
3. Replaces only the header and wrapped DEK portion (first 64 bytes)
4. The data nonce, ciphertext, and authentication tag are byte-for-byte unchanged

`rewrap()` is idempotent: if the ciphertext is already wrapped with the current KEK, it returns the input unchanged. It only operates on v2 envelopes; v0 and v1 data must be fully re-encrypted via `decrypt()` + `encrypt()`.

### What Is Encrypted

| Data                                | Collection               | Fields                                         |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Service master credentials          | `downstream_services`    | `credential_encrypted`                         |
| Per-user service credentials        | `user_service_connections` | `credential_encrypted`                       |
| MFA TOTP secrets                    | `mfa_factors`            | `secret_encrypted`                             |
| Provider OAuth client credentials   | `provider_configs`       | `client_id_encrypted`, `client_secret_encrypted` |
| User provider OAuth tokens          | `user_provider_tokens`   | `access_token_encrypted`, `refresh_token_encrypted` |
| User provider API keys              | `user_provider_tokens`   | `api_key_encrypted`                            |
| User provider OAuth app credentials | `user_provider_credentials` | `client_id_encrypted`, `client_secret_encrypted` |
| OAuth state secrets                 | `oauth_states`           | `code_verifier`, `device_code_encrypted`, `user_code_encrypted` |

### Key Management

- The encryption key must be generated using a cryptographically secure RNG: `openssl rand -hex 32`
- Never reuse the development key in production
- All instances in a horizontal scaling setup must share the same `ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `ENCRYPTION_KEY_PREVIOUS`
- Only one previous key is supported at a time
- The key is validated at startup -- all-zero keys are rejected
- The `EncryptionKeys` struct redacts key material in `Debug` output to prevent accidental logging
- `/health` exposes decrypt counters so operators can confirm whether traffic still depends on `v2_previous`, `v1_current`, `v1_previous`, `v0_current`, or `v0_previous`
- v2 envelope encryption ensures the KEK never directly touches plaintext data -- only per-record DEKs encrypt data

### Key Rotation

NyxID supports zero-downtime key rotation via the `ENCRYPTION_KEY_PREVIOUS` environment variable. Existing ciphertexts continue to decrypt during the rotation window, and all new writes use the new key immediately.

**Rotation procedure:**

1. Generate a new key:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -hex 32
   ```
2. Set `ENCRYPTION_KEY_PREVIOUS` to the current value of `ENCRYPTION_KEY`
3. Set `ENCRYPTION_KEY` to the newly generated key
4. Restart all NyxID instances
5. Verify the service is healthy: `curl /health`
6. All new encryptions now use the new key (v2 envelope format). Existing data decrypts via the fallback chain.
7. For v2 ciphertexts: run a background job calling `rewrap()` on each record (re-wraps only the 60-byte DEK blob, data untouched). For v0/v1 ciphertexts: re-encrypt via `decrypt()` + `encrypt()`.
8. Watch `/health` and wait until `decrypt_stats.v2_previous`, `decrypt_stats.v1_current`, `decrypt_stats.v1_previous`, `decrypt_stats.v0_current`, and `decrypt_stats.v0_previous` remain at zero for your normal workload window.
9. Remove `ENCRYPTION_KEY_PREVIOUS` and restart once you have confirmed the old key is no longer needed.

**Important:** Only one previous key is supported, so you must finish re-wrapping/re-encrypting old-key data before rotating again.

### Key Rotation Rollback

If a key rotation causes issues, you can roll back:

1. Set `ENCRYPTION_KEY` back to the old key value
2. Set `ENCRYPTION_KEY_PREVIOUS` to the new key (so any v1 data encrypted with the new key during the rotation window still decrypts)
3. Restart all NyxID instances
4. Verify the service is healthy: `curl /health`

Both old (v0 and v1) ciphertexts encrypted with the original key and new v1 ciphertexts encrypted during the rotation window will decrypt correctly, as long as the old key remains configured as `ENCRYPTION_KEY_PREVIOUS`.

### Memory Protection

Decrypted secrets use the `zeroize` crate's `Zeroizing<Vec<u8>>` wrapper, which overwrites memory on drop. This prevents sensitive data from lingering in process memory after use.

---

## OAuth Security

### PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)

NyxID enforces PKCE on two distinct OAuth flows:

**1. NyxID as OIDC Provider (downstream services authenticating via NyxID):**
- Method: S256 (SHA-256)
- `code_challenge` is mandatory on all authorization requests
- The code verifier is verified during token exchange

**2. NyxID as OAuth Client (connecting to external providers):**
- PKCE is used when `supports_pkce = true` on the provider configuration
- Code verifier: 32 random bytes, base64url-encoded (43 characters)
- Code challenge: SHA-256 of the verifier, base64url-encoded
- The code verifier is stored encrypted in the `oauth_states` collection

### OAuth State / CSRF Protection

- Each OAuth initiation creates an `oauth_states` record with a unique UUID
- The state parameter maps to this record
- State records expire (short TTL) and are consumed atomically via `find_one_and_delete`
- The callback verifies the session user matches the state's `user_id` to prevent cross-user attacks

### Token Exchange Security

- **No-redirect HTTP client (SEC-H2):** Token exchange requests use a dedicated `reqwest::Client` configured with `redirect::Policy::none()`. This prevents SSRF attacks where a malicious provider could redirect the token exchange request to an internal service.
- **Error body truncation (SEC-M5):** Error responses from providers are truncated to 200 characters before storing in the database, preventing log injection or storage exhaustion.

| Revocation       | Soft deactivation              |

---

## Identity Propagation Security

### CRLF Injection Prevention (SEC-M1)

All identity header values pass through `sanitize_header_value()` which strips:
- Carriage return (`\r`)
- Line feed (`\n`)
- Null byte (`\0`)

This prevents CRLF injection attacks where a malicious display name like `"Alice\r\nX-Admin: true"` could inject additional headers.

### Short-Lived Identity JWTs

Identity assertion JWTs have a 60-second TTL to minimize the replay window. Claims include:
- `sub` -- User ID
- `iss` -- NyxID issuer
- `aud` -- Target service (scoped, preventing cross-service reuse)
- `jti` -- Unique token ID
- `nyx_service_id` -- Explicit service binding

### Per-Service Audience

The `aud` claim is set to the service's `identity_jwt_audience` (or `base_url` as fallback). This ensures an identity JWT captured from one service cannot be replayed against another.

### Claim Minimization

Each service explicitly opts into which claims to include:
- `identity_include_user_id` -- User ID
- `identity_include_email` -- Email address
- `identity_include_name` -- Display name

Services only receive the identity information they need.

---

## Proxy Security

### SSRF Protection

Base URLs for downstream services and OAuth provider endpoints are validated against:

- **Scheme check:** Must be `http://` or `https://`
- **Cloud metadata blocklist:** `metadata.google.internal`, `169.254.169.254`, `[fd00:ec2::254]`

Private IPs (`10.x`, `172.16-31.x`, `192.168.x`, `127.x`) and `localhost` are allowed. NyxID is a self-hosted platform where services commonly run on private infrastructure, especially when accessed via node agents that inject credentials on-premise.

### Path Traversal Prevention

Proxy paths containing `..` or `//` are rejected to prevent path traversal attacks against downstream services.

### Header Allowlists

**Request headers forwarded to downstream:**
`content-type`, `accept`, `accept-language`, `accept-encoding`, `content-length`, `user-agent`, `x-request-id`, `x-correlation-id`

All other headers (including `Authorization`, `Cookie`) are stripped.

**Response headers returned to client:**
`content-type`, `content-length`, `content-encoding`, `content-language`, `content-disposition`, `cache-control`, `etag`, `last-modified`, `x-request-id`, `x-correlation-id`, `vary`, `access-control-*`

### Body Size Limit

Proxy requests are limited to 10 MB request body. The global body size limit for other endpoints is 1 MB.

### Slug-Based Proxy

The slug-based proxy route (`ANY /api/v1/proxy/s/{slug}/{*path}`) resolves the slug to a service UUID via a MongoDB query on the `slug` field, then delegates to the same `execute_proxy()` pipeline used by the UUID-based route. All security properties (SSRF protection, path traversal prevention, header allowlists, body size limits, credential injection, audit logging) are inherited identically.

Slug resolution only matches active services (`is_active: true`). Inactive services are not resolvable by slug.

---

## Credential Broker Security

### Injection Key Blocklist

To prevent security header injection via credential delegation, the following header names are blocked as `injection_key` values in service provider requirements:

`host`, `authorization`, `cookie`, `set-cookie`, `transfer-encoding`, `content-length`, `connection`, `x-forwarded-for`, `x-forwarded-host`, `x-real-ip`

### Provider Credential Isolation

- Provider OAuth client credentials (`client_id`, `client_secret`) are encrypted separately from user tokens
- User tokens are scoped to `(user_id, provider_config_id)` -- one user cannot access another user's tokens
- Provider deactivation atomically revokes all associated user tokens

### Credential Lifecycle

| Event                | Action                                                      |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| API key connect      | Encrypted and stored; upserts existing token                |
| OAuth connect        | Code exchanged with no-redirect client; tokens encrypted    |
| Token use (proxy)    | Decrypted on-demand; lazy refresh if near expiry            |
| Disconnect           | Status set to `revoked`; encrypted fields set to null       |
| Provider deactivated | All user tokens for that provider are revoked               |

---

## Admin Access Control

### Admin Privilege Enforcement

All admin endpoints (`/api/v1/admin/*`) verify `is_admin = true` by querying the user record from the database on each request. This ensures admin status is checked against the current database state, not a cached JWT claim.

### Self-Protection Mechanisms

Admins are prevented from performing destructive actions on their own account:

| Action                | Self-protection                                    |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Change admin role     | `admin_user_id != target_user_id` enforced         |
| Change active status  | `admin_user_id != target_user_id` enforced         |
| Delete user           | `admin_user_id != target_user_id` enforced         |

These checks prevent an admin from accidentally (or maliciously) locking themselves out or removing their own account.

### Session and Credential Revocation on User Disable

When an admin disables a user (`is_active = false`), the following are immediately revoked:

1. **All sessions** -- Marked as `revoked = true` in the `sessions` collection
2. **All refresh tokens** -- Marked as `revoked = true` in the `refresh_tokens` collection
3. **All API keys** -- Marked as `is_active = false` in the `api_keys` collection

Additionally, the `AuthUser` middleware extractor checks `is_active` on every request for session-based and API-key-based authentication. This means disabled users are locked out on their next request.

### Known Limitation: JWT Access Token Survival

JWT access tokens are stateless and not checked against the database. A disabled user's existing JWT access token remains valid until it expires (default: 15 minutes). This is a deliberate trade-off between performance (no DB lookup per request for JWT auth) and immediate revocation. For time-sensitive lockouts, admins should also revoke all sessions via the session revocation endpoint.

### Cascade User Deletion

When deleting a user, a two-phase approach ensures consistency:

1. **Phase 1:** Mark user as `is_active = false` (prevents authentication during cleanup)
2. **Phase 2:** Delete related documents from 8 collections: `sessions`, `refresh_tokens`, `api_keys`, `user_service_connections`, `user_provider_tokens`, `mfa_factors`, `authorization_codes`, `oauth_states`
3. **Phase 3:** Delete the user document itself

Audit log entries referencing the deleted user are preserved with an orphaned `user_id` reference for traceability.

### Admin Action Audit Logging

All admin user management actions are recorded in the audit log with:

- **Actor:** The admin performing the action (`user_id`)
- **Target:** The user being acted upon (`target_user_id`)
- **Action details:** Specific changes made (e.g., role change, status change)
- **Client metadata:** IP address and user-agent of the admin

Admin audit event types: `admin.user.updated`, `admin.user.role_changed`, `admin.user.status_changed`, `admin.user.password_reset`, `admin.user.deleted`, `admin.user.email_verified`, `admin.user.sessions_revoked`.

RBAC audit event types: `admin.role.created`, `admin.role.updated`, `admin.role.deleted`, `admin.role.assigned`, `admin.role.revoked`, `admin.group.created`, `admin.group.updated`, `admin.group.deleted`, `admin.group.member_added`, `admin.group.member_removed`.

---

## RBAC Security

### System Role Protection

System roles (`admin`, `user`) are seeded at startup with `is_system = true`. They cannot be:
- **Deleted** -- `delete_role()` rejects deletion of system roles
- **Renamed** -- `update_role()` prevents changing the `name` or `slug` of system roles
- **De-flagged** -- The `is_system` field cannot be modified via the API

### Admin-Only Endpoints

All RBAC management endpoints (`/api/v1/admin/roles/*`, `/api/v1/admin/groups/*`) require the `is_admin = true` check, which queries the user record from the database on each request (not cached from JWT claims).

### Permission Model

Permissions are opaque string tags (e.g., `users:read`, `content:write`). NyxID stores and propagates them but does not enforce them internally. Consuming applications are responsible for interpreting permission strings.

### Role Assignment Security

- Only admins can assign or revoke roles via the API
- Role assignment is additive: assigning a role that is already assigned returns a conflict error
- Revoking a role only removes the direct assignment; group-inherited roles are not affected

### Group Membership Security

- Group membership is stored as `group_ids` on the User document
- Adding a user to a group is an admin-only operation
- Removing a user from a group removes the group's inherited roles from the user's effective permissions

### Audit Trail

All RBAC operations (role CRUD, role assignment/revocation, group CRUD, member add/remove) are recorded in the audit log with the admin's user ID, the target resource, client IP, and user-agent.

---

## Token Introspection and Revocation Security

### Client Authentication Requirement

Both the introspection (`POST /oauth/introspect`) and revocation (`POST /oauth/revoke`) endpoints require client authentication via `client_id` and `client_secret` in the request body.

- **Introspection:** Returns `{"active": false}` if client authentication fails (never reveals token validity to unauthorized callers)
- **Revocation:** Returns `200 OK` regardless of authentication result (per RFC 7009, to prevent information leakage)

### Introspection Response Security

- The response includes RBAC claims (`roles`, `groups`, `permissions`) only when the token was issued with those scopes
- The `username` field (user email) is fetched from the database, not from the token, ensuring it reflects the current state
- Revoked refresh tokens return `{"active": false}` (checked against the database)

### Revocation Limitations

- **Refresh tokens:** Revoked immediately in the database (`revoked = true`)
- **Access tokens:** Cannot be explicitly revoked (stateless JWTs). They expire naturally within the configured TTL (default: 15 minutes). This is a deliberate trade-off consistent with the existing session revocation model.

---

## Delegated Access Security

### Security Properties

| Property | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| **Service authentication** | Client credentials (`client_id` + hashed `client_secret`) required for token exchange |
| **User authentication** | Subject token must be a valid, non-expired NyxID access token |
| **Consent verification** | Consent record must exist for `(user_id, client_id)` before token exchange is allowed |
| **Scope limitation** | Delegated token scope is constrained to the client's configured `delegation_scopes` |
| **Time limitation** | Token exchange: 5-minute TTL; MCP injection: 5-minute TTL |
| **Renewable tokens** | Delegation tokens can be refreshed via `POST /api/v1/delegation/refresh`; each refresh issues a new token with fresh 5-minute TTL, same scope and acting client |
| **Consent-on-refresh** | Every refresh validates that the user still has active consent for the acting client; revoking consent immediately blocks future refreshes |
| **Endpoint restriction** | Delegated tokens are blocked from non-proxy/non-LLM endpoints via `reject_delegated_tokens` middleware |
| **No credential exposure** | Services never see user's provider credentials -- only NyxID resolves and injects them |
| **Chained exchange prevention** | Delegated tokens cannot be exchanged for new delegated tokens, preventing indefinite TTL extension |
| **Audit trail** | Token exchange and subsequent proxy requests are audit-logged with both `user_id` and `acting_client_id` |

### MCP Injection Security

When NyxID proxies MCP tool calls, delegation tokens are only injected for services with `inject_delegation_token: true` (default: `false`). Additional security controls:

| Property | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| **Opt-in per service** | `inject_delegation_token` defaults to `false`; must be explicitly enabled by admin |
| **User intent** | User explicitly invoked the tool call; tokens are not pre-generated |
| **Scope control** | Token scope is fixed by admin config (`delegation_token_scope`); service cannot request broader access |
| **Single use window** | 5-minute TTL; token is generated per tool call; refreshable for long-running workflows |
| **Service identity** | `act.sub` claim identifies the downstream service for audit purposes |

### Threat Mitigations

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| **Stolen service credentials** | Client secret is hashed (SHA-256) in storage. Constant-time comparison prevents timing attacks. |
| **Stolen subject token** | Subject tokens are short-lived (15 min). Attacker also needs client_secret for token exchange. |
| **Service acting without consent** | Consent check is mandatory at token exchange and on every refresh. Can be revoked by user at any time via consent management; revocation immediately blocks future refreshes. |
| **Scope escalation** | Delegated scope strictly limited by `delegation_scopes` on the client configuration. |
| **Chained token exchange** | Explicitly rejected: delegated tokens have `delegated: true` and are blocked from exchange. |
| **Token replay** | Delegated tokens have unique JTI and short TTL (5 min). Each refresh issues a new JTI. |
| **Downstream service replays MCP token** | 5-minute TTL. Refreshable via `/api/v1/delegation/refresh` for legitimate long-running workflows; user must remain active and consent must not be revoked for refresh to succeed. |
| **Delegated token used on restricted endpoints** | `reject_delegated_tokens` middleware blocks access to all non-proxy/non-LLM routes. |
| **User deactivation** | `AuthUser` extractor checks `is_active` for every request, including delegated tokens. |

---

## Transaction Approval Security

### Webhook Verification

Telegram webhooks are verified using constant-time comparison of the `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header. To prevent timing side-channels from length differences, both the received and expected values are pre-hashed with SHA-256 before the constant-time comparison:

```rust
let h1 = Sha256::digest(received.as_bytes());
let h2 = Sha256::digest(expected.as_bytes());
h1.ct_eq(&h2).into()
```

The `subtle` crate provides the `ConstantTimeEq` trait.

### Replay Prevention

Approval decisions are processed atomically using MongoDB `findOneAndUpdate` with filter `{ status: "pending" }`. Once status changes from `pending`, subsequent callbacks for the same request are no-ops. The webhook handler always returns 200 OK regardless of outcome to prevent Telegram retries.

### Chat ID Binding

When processing a Telegram callback, the handler verifies that `callback_query.message.chat.id` matches the `telegram_chat_id` stored on the approval request. This prevents a user from approving another user's requests by spoofing callback data.

### Link Code Security

| Property       | Value                                              |

### Idempotency

Approval requests use a SHA-256 idempotency key computed from `(user_id, service_id, requester_type, requester_id)`. The `idempotency_key` field has a unique index in MongoDB. If a pending request with the same key exists, it is returned instead of creating a duplicate. Duplicate key errors from race conditions are handled gracefully.

### Status Polling Endpoint Security

The `GET /api/v1/approvals/requests/{request_id}/status` endpoint requires authentication and verifies the original caller binding:
- `approval_request.user_id` matches the authenticated resource owner
- `approval_request.requester_type` matches the caller auth method
- `approval_request.requester_id` matches the caller identity (user ID, service account ID, or delegated client ID)

This prevents cross-caller polling even if another authenticated principal obtains a `request_id`.

### Approval Decision Authorization

The `POST /api/v1/approvals/requests/{request_id}/decide` endpoint verifies that the authenticated user's ID matches the `user_id` on the approval request. Only the resource owner can approve or reject their own requests.

### Error Message Safety

- Telegram messages show service name and requester label but never show credentials or internal IDs
- The `ApprovalRequired` error response (code 7000) includes the `request_id` but no credential information
- Internal errors during webhook processing are logged but never returned to Telegram

### Audit Trail

All approval decisions are recorded in the audit log with:
- `request_id` and `service_id`
- Whether the request was approved or rejected
- The decision channel (`telegram` or `web`)
- Telegram account linking and disconnection events

## Consent Flow Security

### IDOR Prevention

Consent endpoints use the authenticated user's ID from the `AuthUser` middleware extractor, not from request parameters. This prevents insecure direct object reference (IDOR) attacks where a user could attempt to view or revoke another user's consents.

### Consent Scoping

- `GET /api/v1/users/me/consents` returns only consents belonging to the authenticated user
- `DELETE /api/v1/users/me/consents/{client_id}` deletes only the consent matching both the authenticated user's ID and the specified client ID

### Consent Lifecycle

- Consents are created or updated (upserted) during the OAuth authorization flow
- Revoking a consent does not invalidate existing tokens; it only prevents automatic re-authorization on the next OAuth flow
- Consent records include the granted scopes and optional expiration for audit purposes

---

## Authentication Security

### Password Hashing

- **Algorithm:** Argon2id (recommended by OWASP)
- **Parameters:** m=64MiB, t=3 iterations, p=4 parallelism
- **Salt:** Random per-hash via `SaltString::generate(OsRng)`
- **Max length:** 128 characters (prevents Argon2 DoS)

### Cookie Security

| Cookie              | Flags                                             | Path                      |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `nyx_session`       | HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax, Secure*                   | `/`                       |

\* `Secure` flag is set when `BASE_URL` does not start with `http://localhost` or `http://127.0.0.1`.

NyxID's first-party web app uses only the `nyx_session` cookie for browser authentication. Mobile apps and OAuth clients use bearer access tokens and explicit refresh-token request bodies instead of browser auth cookies.

### Authentication Chain

Requests are authenticated in this order:
1. `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` header
2. `nyx_session` cookie (hashed, looked up in DB)
3. `X-API-Key` header (hashed, looked up in DB)

All methods verify the user is active before granting access.

### Browser CSRF Protection

Unsafe private API requests that look browser-originated, or that carry browser auth cookies, must present an `Origin` or `Referer` matching either `FRONTEND_URL` or `BASE_URL`. This protects first-party cookie-authenticated browser sessions from cross-site request forgery while leaving bearer-token, API-key, and OAuth token endpoint traffic unaffected.

### API Key Scope Population

When authenticating via API key, the key's configured scopes are populated into the `AuthUser.scope` field. This makes scopes available for downstream enforcement (e.g., future per-service scope requirements). Currently, no handler enforces API key scopes -- any valid API key can access all API-key-permitted endpoints. Scope enforcement is planned as a future enhancement.

## HTTP Security Headers

Every response includes:

| Header                       | Value                                              | Purpose                    |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `Strict-Transport-Security`  | `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload`     | Enforce HTTPS              |
| `X-Content-Type-Options`     | `nosniff`                                          | Prevent MIME sniffing      |
| `X-Frame-Options`            | `DENY`                                             | Prevent clickjacking       |
| `Content-Security-Policy`    | `default-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'`       | Restrict resource loading  |
| `Referrer-Policy`            | `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`                  | Control referrer leakage   |
| `Permissions-Policy`         | `camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), interest-cohort=()` | Restrict browser APIs |
| `X-XSS-Protection`          | `1; mode=block`                                    | Legacy XSS protection      |

---

## Rate Limiting

Dual-layer rate limiting protects against abuse:

1. **Per-IP:** Sliding window counter per client IP
2. **Global:** Token-bucket algorithm as throughput safety net

| Setting                  | Default | Environment Variable        |
|--------------------------|---------|------------------------------|
| Per-IP limit             | 30/sec  | `RATE_LIMIT_BURST`           |
| Global sustained rate    | 10/sec  | `RATE_LIMIT_PER_SECOND`      |
| Global burst capacity    | 30      | `RATE_LIMIT_BURST`           |

Rate limit state is per-instance (in-memory). For distributed deployments, consider rate limiting at the reverse proxy level.

## Incident Response

### If ENCRYPTION_KEY Is Compromised

1. Generate a new key: `openssl rand -hex 32`
2. Set `ENCRYPTION_KEY_PREVIOUS` to the compromised key value
3. Set `ENCRYPTION_KEY` to the new key
4. Restart all NyxID instances (zero-downtime rotation -- existing data decrypts via the fallback chain)
5. Run a re-encryption job to migrate all data to the new key (removes dependency on the compromised key)
6. Once all data is re-encrypted, remove `ENCRYPTION_KEY_PREVIOUS` and restart
7. Audit all access logs for the compromise window

### If RSA Private Key Is Compromised

1. Generate a new key pair
2. Replace key files at the configured paths
3. Restart all NyxID instances
4. All existing JWTs are immediately invalidated
5. Users must re-authenticate

### If a Provider Token Is Compromised

1. User disconnects from the provider via `DELETE /api/v1/providers/{id}/disconnect`
2. User revokes the token directly with the provider (e.g., OpenAI dashboard)
3. User reconnects with a new token/key

### If Suspicious Activity Is Detected

1. Review the audit log: `GET /api/v1/admin/audit-log`
2. Filter by specific user: `GET /api/v1/admin/audit-log?user_id=<suspect_id>`
3. Check for unusual `proxy_request` patterns or `provider_token_connected` events
4. Check for admin action events: `admin.user.role_changed`, `admin.user.deleted`
5. Disable compromised user accounts: `PATCH /api/v1/admin/users/<user_id>/status` with `{"is_active": false}` (automatically revokes sessions, refresh tokens, and API keys)
6. If needed, force password reset: `POST /api/v1/admin/users/<user_id>/reset-password`
7. Revoke all sessions: `DELETE /api/v1/admin/users/<user_id>/sessions`
8. Rotate affected credentials
