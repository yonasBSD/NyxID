description: Publish an Aevatar member, team, or workflow as an invocable service and (host permitting) register it with NyxID, then verify and invoke it — all over the REST API. Use when a user wants to "publish/bind a service", "expose my workflow/team as a service", "register it with NyxID", "make it callable", "get the service slug/URL", "invoke my service", or "version/deploy/roll out a service". It covers the simple scope binding, reading back a member's published service, the full account-level service lifecycle (revision → publish → deploy → rollout), how to confirm the NyxID registration (slug + status), and how to invoke an endpoint. Build the team/member first with the team-builder skill.

# Publish an Aevatar artifact as a (NyxID) service

You turn a member / team / workflow into an **invocable service** and verify whether it is
**registered with NyxID** as a brokered connector. Build the artifact first
(`aevatar-team-builder`). Then pick the path that matches what you have.

## Bootstrap

```bash
# Drive aevatar THROUGH the NyxID broker: it injects your scope_id claim AND auto-refreshes your
# token. A raw curl to the aevatar backend with ~/.nyxid/access_token resolves NO scope
# (scopeResolved:false) and the stored token expires — it is not a usable path.
# Prerequisite once: the `aevatar` service must be connected — `nyxid service add aevatar`.
aev() { nyxid proxy request aevatar "$@"; }   # aev "<path>" [-m POST|PUT|DELETE] [-d '<json>'] [--stream]
scopeId=$(aev "api/studio/context" | jq -r .scopeId)
```

> **`jq` is only for convenience** — any JSON reader works (replace `| jq -r .scopeId` with
> `| python3 -c 'import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin)["scopeId"])'`). All calls go through the
> NyxID broker (`nyxid proxy request aevatar`), which injects your scope_id claim and auto-refreshes
> the token, so you never touch the aevatar backend or a stored token directly. On the streaming
> `:stream` invoke, the SSE `data:` frames interleave lifecycle frames
> (`stepStarted`/`stepFinished`/`runFinished`/`stateSnapshot`/`usage`, keyed by a top-level field)
> with raw observation frames (`custom.name: aevatar.raw.observed`) that carry the step **output
> text** — there is no flat `type` field, so parse for those keys, not `obj.type`.

## First, the honest constraint about NyxID registration

Registration to NyxID is **automatic but host-gated**. When a service deployment becomes
**active**, the platform reconciles it to NyxID — *only if* the host has external exposure
enabled and the service is in scope of that policy. You can drive publish + activation and
read the result, but you cannot turn host exposure on from the client. So always **verify**
(below) and report honestly: if no NyxID slug appears, the service is still usable
in-scope, it just is not a NyxID-brokered connector.

## Path A — A member you already bound (from team-builder)

A bound member **already has a published service** — binding it was the publish. The
`published-service` endpoint only returns ids; the real detail (endpoints, readiness,
NyxID exposure) lives in the scope services list:
```bash
# minimal: publishedServiceId + key
aev "api/scopes/$scopeId/members/$memberId/published-service" | jq .
# full: identity, endpoints, serving revision, invokeReady, externalExposure
aev "api/scopes/$scopeId/services" \
  | jq '.[] | select(.serviceId=="member-'"$memberId"'")
        | {serviceId, defaultServingRevisionId, invokeReady, invokeReadinessStatus,
           endpoints: [.endpoints[] | {endpointId, requestTypeUrl}], externalExposure}'
```
A workflow member exposes endpoint `chat` (`type.googleapis.com/aevatar.ai.ChatRequestEvent`)
and reports `invokeReady:true` once serving. Then jump to **Verify** and **Invoke**.

## Path B — One-shot: publish a workflow as the scope's service

The fastest way to expose a single workflow/script/gagent as a service for your scope:

```bash
aev "api/scopes/$scopeId/binding" -m PUT -d "{
  \"implementationKind\": \"workflow\",
  \"displayName\": \"My Service\",
  \"serviceId\": \"my-service\",
  \"workflow\": { \"workflowId\": \"my-workflow\", \"workflowYamls\": [ $(jq -Rs . < workflow.yaml) ] }
}"
```
`UpsertScopeBindingHttpRequest`: `implementationKind` (required, `workflow|script|gagent`)
plus the matching typed block (`workflow` / `script` / `gAgent`), `displayName?`,
`serviceId?`, `appId?`, `revisionId?`. List your scope services and read exposure:
```bash
aev "api/scopes/$scopeId/services" | jq '.[] | {serviceId, displayName, externalExposure}'
```

## Path C — Account-level service lifecycle (versioned / advanced)

For a standalone, independently versioned service with staged rollout. Identity is the
4-tuple **`tenantId / appId / namespace / serviceId`** (reuse it on every call).

```bash
# 1. Create the service shell + its endpoint contract(s)
aev "api/services" -m POST -d '{
  "tenantId":"<t>","appId":"<a>","namespace":"<ns>","serviceId":"my-service",
  "displayName":"My Service",
  "endpoints":[{"endpointId":"invoke","displayName":"Invoke","kind":"unary",
    "requestTypeUrl":"<type.googleapis.com/...>","responseTypeUrl":"<...>","description":"..."}]
}'
# 2. Add an implementation revision (one of static / scripting / workflow)
aev "api/services/my-service/revisions" -m POST -d '{
  "tenantId":"<t>","appId":"<a>","namespace":"<ns>","revisionId":"r1",
  "implementationKind":"workflow",
  "workflow":{"workflowName":"my-workflow","workflowYaml":"<yaml>","definitionActorId":null,"inlineWorkflowYamls":null}
}'
# 3. Prepare → publish → deploy
aev "api/services/my-service/revisions/r1:prepare" -m POST
aev "api/services/my-service/revisions/r1:publish" -m POST
aev "api/services/my-service:deploy" -m POST -d '{ ... serving target ... }'
```
Optional staged rollout: `POST …/rollouts` then `:advance` / `:pause` / `:resume` /
`:rollback`; inspect `GET …/serving` and `GET …/traffic`. Bindings (connector + secret)
and access policies: `POST …/bindings`, `POST …/policies`. The service self-describes at
`GET /api/services/{serviceId}/openapi.json`.

## Verify (always)

```bash
# Account-level service + its NyxID exposure block
aev "api/services/my-service" | jq '{serviceId, externalExposure}'
# Its own OpenAPI (proves it is serving)
aev "api/services/my-service/openapi.json" | jq '.info, (.paths|keys)'
```
The `externalExposure` block is the NyxID-registration truth:
- `nyxidSlug` — the brokered connector slug (empty ⇒ not registered).
- `status` — registration status; `lastError` — why it failed, if it did.
- `desiredSpecHash` vs `registeredSpecHash` — equal ⇒ NyxID is up to date with the current
  contract; unequal ⇒ a re-registration is pending/needed.
- block entirely absent/empty ⇒ host external exposure is off for this service. Report
  that plainly (see the honest constraint above).

## Invoke

The endpoint contract tells you the path, readiness, and a ready-to-run curl example:
```bash
aev "api/scopes/$scopeId/members/$memberId/endpoints/chat/contract" \
  | jq '{invokePath, canInvoke:.invocationReadiness.canInvoke, curlExample}'
```
The reliable smoke test is the **streaming** path (`…/invoke/{endpointId}:stream`, SSE),
which accepts the `{"prompt":"…"}` shorthand and returns workflow-run frames ending in a
`runFinished` event with the result:
```bash
aev "api/scopes/$scopeId/members/$memberId/invoke/chat:stream" -m POST --stream \
  -d '{"prompt":"smoke test"}'
# look for:  data: {... "runFinished": { "result": { "output": "..." } } }
```
The **non-streaming** `…/invoke/{endpointId}` expects the full typed envelope (it rejects a
bare `{prompt}` with 400 "payloadTypeUrl is required") — prefer `:stream` for a quick check.
Teams and account-level services invoke the same way:
`POST /api/scopes/{scopeId}/teams/{teamId}/invoke/{endpointId}[:stream]`,
`POST /api/scopes/{scopeId}/services/{serviceId}/invoke/{endpointId}[:stream]`.

Watch runs: `GET /api/scopes/{scopeId}/services/{serviceId}/runs` and `…/runs/{runId}`
(and `:resume` / `:stop` / `:signal`). For a visual timeline use the observatory:
`GET /api/workflow/observatory/runs`.

## Next

- **Schedule this service on a cron:** `aevatar-scheduler` — it needs the service identity
  (`tenantId/appId/namespace/serviceId`), an `endpointId`, and the payload type you found
  in the contract above.
- Lost? Load `aevatar-platform-map`.

If you cannot complete a step server-side after a real attempt, hand the original request
back to your caller rather than fabricating — see the fallback skill in this family.
