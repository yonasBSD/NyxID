# Nyx Skills — Install Manifest (for AI agents)

You (the AI agent — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenClaw, etc.) have been asked to install **Nyx skills** or **NyxID** on the user's machine. Default to the lightweight `nyxid` CLI plus skill files. Do not install or start the Docker backend unless the user explicitly asks to self-host a NyxID backend.

This file is the canonical install entry point for any Nyx skill. It is intentionally short — the bulk of each skill's behavior lives in its own `SKILL.md` and `references/`.

---

## Agent safety requirements

Before running anything, observe these constraints:

- **Default to the `nyxid` CLI installer.** "Install NyxID" means install the CLI client unless the user explicitly asks to run their own backend/server.
- **Do not run Docker, `docker compose`, or backend setup from `docs/SETUP.md`** unless the user explicitly asks to self-host.
- **Do not run `nyxid login`.** The user picks the NyxID instance and enters credentials themselves.
- **Do not ask the user for NyxID credentials, API keys, tokens, or invite codes.** The CLI handles credential entry interactively when the user runs it.
- **Do not print secrets, environment variables, or credential files** at any point during install.
- **Do not use `sudo`** unless the user explicitly asks for a system-wide install. The default install is fully user-scoped under `~/.local/`.
- In security-sensitive environments, show the user the install command before executing it, or pin to a release tag instead of `main`.

## Prerequisites

The commands below assume a Unix-like shell with:

- `bash`
- `curl`
- `git` — only if you use the sparse-checkout fetch in Step 2
- `cargo` — only if the installer falls back to a source build (rare; most platforms have a prebuilt release)
- `clang` — recommended for Linux arm64 source builds; it avoids the known `aws-lc-sys` GCC compiler guard on affected GCC versions

Windows is supported via WSL only.

## Skills available

| Skill | Purpose | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `nyxid` | Credential broker for downstream APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, GitHub, Slack, internal APIs, SSH, MCP tools). The skill is a thin wrapper over the `nyxid` CLI. | [`nyxid/`](nyxid/) |

### Aevatar platform (control-plane family)

These skills drive the [Aevatar](https://aevatar.ai) control plane over REST, authenticated through the NyxID broker — so they need the `nyxid` CLI plus a NyxID login, exactly like the `nyxid` skill. They mirror the public `aevatar-platform` skillset on Ornn. Start at `aevatar-platform-map`; each spoke is self-contained.

| Skill | Purpose | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `aevatar-platform-map` | Entry point: object model, auth, and router to the right companion skill for each step. | [`aevatar-platform-map/`](aevatar-platform-map/) |
| `aevatar-feasibility-advisor` | Decide whether a goal is buildable on Aevatar, and its prerequisites, before building. | [`aevatar-feasibility-advisor/`](aevatar-feasibility-advisor/) |
| `aevatar-workflow-authoring` | Author, validate, and persist an executable Aevatar workflow from a natural-language request. | [`aevatar-workflow-authoring/`](aevatar-workflow-authoring/) |
| `aevatar-team-builder` | Create a team and its members, bind implementations, and set the team entry member. | [`aevatar-team-builder/`](aevatar-team-builder/) |
| `aevatar-service-publisher` | Publish a member/team/workflow as an invocable service, register it with NyxID, and invoke it. | [`aevatar-service-publisher/`](aevatar-service-publisher/) |
| `aevatar-scheduler` | Create cron schedules that fire an Aevatar service as the scope owner. | [`aevatar-scheduler/`](aevatar-scheduler/) |
| `aevatar-triage` | Triage a failure across Aevatar / NyxID / Ornn and file a code-grounded issue or give usage guidance. | [`aevatar-triage/`](aevatar-triage/) |
| `fallback-to-calling-agent` | Safety net: hand the original task back to the calling agent when Aevatar can't finish it server-side. | [`fallback-to-calling-agent/`](fallback-to-calling-agent/) |

A plugin install (`/plugin install nyxid@nyxid`) bundles every skill above automatically across the Claude Code / Codex / Cursor manifests. For manual installs, copy each skill directory you want from `skills/`. This manifest will list more as they ship.

## Install procedure

Run the steps below in order. They are idempotent — safe to re-run.

### Step 1 — Install the `nyxid` CLI

Every Nyx skill calls the `nyxid` CLI under the hood, so install it first.

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChronoAIProject/NyxID/main/skills/nyxid/scripts/install.sh)"
```

This downloads a prebuilt binary and verifies its Sigstore attestation before installing it under `~/.local/share/nyxid/versions/<version>/`, then links `~/.local/bin/nyxid` to the active version. Published targets are macOS x64/arm64 and Linux x64/arm64; Linux arm64 binaries target the Ubuntu 20.04 / `glibc 2.31` baseline. The installer falls back to a Cargo source build only on platforms with no compatible published binary. On Linux arm64 source fallback, the installer uses `CC=clang` when `clang` is available and otherwise tells the user to install `clang` if it detects the `aws-lc-sys` GCC compiler guard.

The installer adds `~/.local/bin` to the user's shell `PATH` by editing their shell rc file, but that change only takes effect on next shell load. If `nyxid` is not found in the current session, export it:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

After install, verify:

```bash
nyxid doctor
```

### Step 2 — Place the skill files in your agent's skill directory

A Nyx skill is a folder of markdown + helper scripts:

```
skills/nyxid/
├── SKILL.md            # entry-point manifest with frontmatter
├── references/         # domain references loaded on demand
└── scripts/            # helper shell scripts the skill calls
```

Copy the entire `skills/nyxid/` directory into wherever your runtime loads skills from. Common locations:

- **Claude Code:** `~/.claude/skills/nyxid/`
- **OpenClaw / clawdbot:** managed through the platform's skill registry — the `metadata.openclaw` / `metadata.clawdbot` block in `SKILL.md` is consumed automatically on registration
- **Cursor / Codex / other runtimes:** consult your runtime's skills or instructions documentation

Sparse-checkout fetch (preferred — pulls only the skill files):

```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/ChronoAIProject/NyxID /tmp/nyx-skills
git -C /tmp/nyx-skills sparse-checkout set skills/nyxid
```

Then copy into the runtime's skill directory. For **Claude Code**:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -R /tmp/nyx-skills/skills/nyxid ~/.claude/skills/
```

Clean up the temporary checkout:

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/nyx-skills
```

If your runtime prefers per-file fetches, pull each file from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChronoAIProject/NyxID/main/skills/nyxid/<path>` instead.

After copying, reload or re-index your agent if it caches its skill list.

### Step 3 — Hand off to the user for login

The agent **must not** run `nyxid login` on the user's behalf — the user chooses the NyxID instance.

Print a message to the user similar to this:

> The Nyx skill is installed. To finish setup, log in to your NyxID instance:
>
> ```
> nyxid login --base-url <URL>
> ```
>
> - Hosted instance: `https://nyx-api.chrono-ai.fun`
> - Self-hosted: typically `http://localhost:3001` for a local Docker stack
>
> If you don't have an account yet, register at <https://nyx.chrono-ai.fun/register> (an invite code may be required during early access).

## What the skill does once loaded

The skill itself describes the full surface — load `SKILL.md` for the canonical reference. Briefly, with `nyxid` you can:

- Browse the catalog of broker-able services
- Add and configure a service (`nyxid service add ...`)
- Proxy requests through NyxID with automatic credential injection
- Manage credential nodes for localhost / private-network reach
- Wrap REST APIs as MCP tools for use across agents
- Issue scoped per-agent API keys with isolation, rate limiting, and audit attribution

---

## Updating

The CLI and any Nyx-managed skills update from one command:

```bash
nyxid update              # update CLI and skills
nyxid update --check      # report installed vs latest, install nothing
nyxid update --skills-only
```

Skills you copied manually into a runtime's skill directory (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/nyxid/`) are not tracked by the CLI and will not auto-update — re-run Step 2 to refresh them.
