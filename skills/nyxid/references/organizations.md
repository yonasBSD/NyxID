NyxID supports **organizations** for sharing a single set of credentials across multiple users. The classic example is a family Home Assistant or a company OpenAI key: one credential record, many people calling it through their own NyxID accounts. The proxy automatically falls back to org credentials when a personal one is missing for the requested service, with full per-member audit attribution.

## Mental model

- An **org is just a special user** (`user_type: "org"`) that cannot log in directly. It owns its own services, endpoints, API keys, etc., the same way a person does.
- **Membership** lives in `org_memberships`. Each member has a **role** (`admin` / `member` / `viewer`) and a `scope_source` — either `inherit` (follow the role's default) or `override` (use the membership row's own list). Admins manage everything; members can use org services through the proxy; viewers can see them in `nyxid service list` but cannot proxy through them.
- **Role-level defaults** live in `org_role_scopes` (one row per `(org_user_id, role)`). Admins pin each role's allowed services via `nyxid org role-scope set`; new members default to `scope_source = inherit` and pick up changes immediately. `override` members are unaffected by role edits until reset back to `inherit`. Missing role-scope rows mean "full access" — nothing is restricted until an admin configures one.
- **Resolution priority:** when a proxy request comes in, NyxID first looks for a personal `UserService` matching the slug. Only if that misses does it walk the user's active memberships (in `primary_org_id` order, then earliest-joined) and try the org's services. Personal credentials always win.
- **`credential_source` on `nyxid service list`**: every service in the response is tagged with `{ "type": "personal" }` or `{ "type": "org", "org_id": ..., "org_name": ..., "role": ..., "allowed": ... }`. Use this to tell the user which credentials are theirs vs. shared.

## Creating and managing an org

```bash
# Create an org. You become the first admin.
nyxid org create --display-name "Chrono AI"

# List all orgs you belong to
nyxid org list

# Show details (member count, your role)
nyxid org show <ORG_ID>

# Update metadata (admin only). Pass --avatar-url "" to clear.
nyxid org update <ORG_ID> --display-name "New Name"

# Delete (admin only). Refuses if the org still owns any shared services,
# endpoints, API keys, NyxID API keys, or non-revoked provider tokens --
# transfer or delete those first. Deleting an org service auto-cleans the
# linked provider token when no other org service uses it; the orphan-token
# escape hatch for older orgs is `nyxid provider disconnect --org` (below).
nyxid org delete <ORG_ID> --yes
```

## Sharing a service with the org

An org admin creates a shared service by passing `--org <ORG_ID>` to `nyxid service add`. The resulting `UserService`, `UserEndpoint`, and `UserApiKey` rows are written with `user_id = <org_user_id>`, so every member of the org immediately sees the service in their `nyxid service list` (tagged with `credential_source.type = "org"`) and can proxy through it using their own NyxID account.

```bash
# Shared OpenAI key for the whole org (API key credential)
nyxid service add llm-openai --org 1c3f8e2a-...

# OAuth flow targeted at the org. The browser opens under YOUR login, you
# grant access to the org's copy of the provider, and the resulting token
# is stored under the org's user_id so every member can proxy through it.
nyxid service add api-google --oauth --org 1c3f8e2a-...

# Device-code flow targeted at the org
nyxid service add llm-anthropic --device-code --org 1c3f8e2a-...

# Custom endpoint targeted at the org
nyxid service add --custom --org 1c3f8e2a-... \
  --label "Shared Home Assistant" \
  --endpoint-url https://ha.home.local:8123 \
  --auth-method bearer

# Node-routed shared service. The credential lives on the admin's
# personal node (encrypted at rest there) but the org service points
# at it. Every org member's proxy calls flow: NyxID -> admin's node ->
# downstream API. The admin must have write access to the node (which
# they do because it's their personal node); the node itself does not
# need to be re-registered under the org.
nyxid service add llm-openai --org 1c3f8e2a-... --via-node my-laptop-node
# Then on the node:
nyxid node credentials setup --service llm-openai
```

The backend enforces that the caller is an admin of the target org before writing the row (returns `8103 org_role_insufficient` otherwise). Creating or updating an org-owned service respects the admin's **effective** scope (per-member override if set, otherwise the role's default) just like the proxy path — a scoped admin cannot reach a service outside their effective allow-list.

> **How org-OAuth works under the hood.** The CLI creates a placeholder `UserApiKey` under the org's user_id (`POST /keys` with `target_org_id`), then initiates the OAuth / device-code flow with `target_org_id=X` on the query string. The backend stores the resulting `UserProviderToken` with `user_id = org`, and the sync routine matches it to the placeholder because both share the same user_id. The admin's personal scope is untouched -- the grant lives entirely under the org. If you prefer a dedicated identity for the org's OAuth grants (so personal account compromise does not leak the org credential), create a dedicated service account and use its token for the initial `nyxid login` before running `nyxid service add ... --oauth --org <X>`.

> Viewer-role members still see org services in the list (tagged `credential_source.allowed = false`) but cannot click into their detail page or proxy through them. Scoped members only see services within their `allowed_service_ids` scope -- services outside the scope are hidden entirely, not just disabled.

The frontend `/keys` page groups personal vs. each org section, with viewer-role and out-of-scope items rendered read-only. The frontend `/providers` page exposes the same org scope selector for org admins, so an admin can list and disconnect tokens owned by any org they administer.

## Disconnecting a provider token

Most users never need this directly: deleting the last `UserService` backed by a provider auto-soft-revokes the linked `UserProviderToken` (node-managed services do not count toward "in use"). The explicit command is the escape hatch for orphan tokens left behind by older releases or for unusual cleanup flows.

```bash
# Disconnect a personal provider token
nyxid provider disconnect <PROVIDER_ID>

# Disconnect an org-owned provider token (admin required)
nyxid provider disconnect <PROVIDER_ID> --org <ORG_ID>
```

`<PROVIDER_ID>` is the provider config UUID, not the slug -- get it from `nyxid catalog list --output json` or from the token row in the `/providers` page. The command revokes the token (any value of `status != "revoked"` flips to `"revoked"`) and syncs the change into the matching `UserApiKey` rows so dependent services flip back to `pending_auth` until they are reconnected. Once the org's last non-revoked provider token is gone, `nyxid org delete` succeeds.

## Inviting members

```bash
# Issue a one-time invite (admin only). Default role is member, default TTL 24h.
nyxid org invite create <ORG_ID> --role member
nyxid org invite create <ORG_ID> --role viewer --ttl-hours 168

# Restrict the invitee to specific UserService IDs (comma-separated, implies override)
nyxid org invite create <ORG_ID> --role member --allowed-service-ids "<svc1>,<svc2>"

# Force inherit mode (ignores any --allowed-service-ids you also pass)
nyxid org invite create <ORG_ID> --role member --scope-source inherit

# The output includes a join link AND a bare nonce. Share whichever is convenient:
#   Join link: https://<frontend>/orgs/join/ORGINV-...
#   CLI:       nyxid org join ORGINV-...

# Recipient redeems while signed in
nyxid org join ORGINV-ABCDEF12345678
nyxid org join "https://nyx.example.com/orgs/join/ORGINV-..."   # full URL also works

# List or cancel pending invites
nyxid org invite list <ORG_ID>
nyxid org invite cancel <ORG_ID> <INVITE_ID> --yes
```

Direct add (without an invite) is also available for tooling but not recommended:

```bash
nyxid org member add <ORG_ID> --user-id <USER_ID> --role member
```

## Managing members

```bash
# List members of an org (any member can read). Shows each member's role,
# scope mode (inherit/override), and effective allowed services.
nyxid org member list <ORG_ID>

# Change a member's role (admin only)
nyxid org member update <ORG_ID> <MEMBER_USER_ID> --role admin

# Flip a member back to the role's default scope
nyxid org member update <ORG_ID> <MEMBER_USER_ID> --scope-source inherit

# Set a per-member override
nyxid org member update <ORG_ID> <MEMBER_USER_ID> \
  --scope-source override --allowed-service-ids "<svc1>,<svc2>"

# Shortcut: passing --allowed-service-ids without --scope-source implies override
nyxid org member update <ORG_ID> <MEMBER_USER_ID> --allowed-service-ids "<svc1>,<svc2>"
nyxid org member update <ORG_ID> <MEMBER_USER_ID> --allowed-service-ids ""    # clear to full-access override

# Remove a member (admin only). Re-adding later reactivates the same membership row.
nyxid org member remove <ORG_ID> <MEMBER_USER_ID> --yes
```

## Managing role-level scopes (per-role defaults)

Admins can pin a default allowed-services list for each role. New members (and
any member with `scope_source = inherit`) automatically pick up the role's
scope. Per-member overrides win and are unaffected by role edits — so
tightening a role's scope never silently narrows an explicitly-overridden
member.

```bash
# Show defaults for admin / member / viewer (admin only)
nyxid org role-scope list <ORG_ID>

# Restrict the `member` role to two specific services
nyxid org role-scope set <ORG_ID> --role member \
  --allowed-service-ids "<svc1>,<svc2>"

# Grant the `admin` role full access (the default, but pins an explicit row)
nyxid org role-scope set <ORG_ID> --role admin --full-access

# Remove the row entirely — role reverts to the default (full access)
nyxid org role-scope clear <ORG_ID> --role viewer
```

Deleting an org-owned service automatically prunes its ID from every role
scope and every membership override, so stale IDs never linger.

## Multi-org tiebreaker: `primary_org_id`

When a user belongs to multiple orgs that all happen to share the same service slug, the proxy needs a deterministic winner. The default is the earliest-joined org. To override:

```bash
nyxid org set-primary --org-id <ORG_ID>      # set
nyxid org set-primary --clear                # unset (revert to earliest-joined)
```

## Working with org services in agents

For an AI agent making proxy requests, **nothing changes by default**. The agent calls `nyxid proxy request <slug> ...` exactly as before. NyxID looks up the credential -- personal first, then org -- and injects it. The audit log records `routed_via: "personal"` or `routed_via: "org"` (with `org_user_id` and `member_user_id`) so the org admin can see who used what.

If the user has both a personal and an org credential for the same slug and wants to explicitly choose which one the proxy uses, pass `--via-service <USER_SERVICE_ID>`:

```bash
# List services to see both personal and org entries with their IDs
nyxid service list --output json

# Use the org credential explicitly (bypasses personal-first auto-resolution)
nyxid proxy request llm-openai /chat/completions -m POST \
  --via-service <ORG_USER_SERVICE_ID> \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
```

The `?_nyxid_via=` param is stripped before forwarding to the downstream service, so the downstream never sees NyxID routing metadata.

When listing services for the user, **always print the `credential_source` field** so the user can tell which credentials are theirs and which are shared. Viewer-role items have `credential_source.allowed = false`; do not attempt to proxy through them -- the request will return `8103 org_role_insufficient`.

## Org-level approval policies

An org admin can require approval whenever any member uses a specific org-owned service. Unlike personal per-service configs, **the org policy is dominant**: it overrides the member's personal approval gate for that service.

```bash
# Set an org policy: every member must get an admin's approval before
# their proxy call through this org service goes through. Per-request mode.
nyxid approval set-config <SERVICE_ID> --org <ORG_ID> --require-approval true

# Same but use time-based grant mode (approval creates a reusable grant)
nyxid approval set-config <SERVICE_ID> --org <ORG_ID> --require-approval true --approval-mode grant

# List current org-level policies on org-owned services
nyxid approval service-configs --org <ORG_ID> --output json

# List approval requests filed against org services (admin-only view)
nyxid approval list --org <ORG_ID> --output json

# List active grants created from org-policy approvals (grant mode only).
# These live under the org's user_id, so this is the only way for admins
# to see / revoke them.
nyxid approval grants --org <ORG_ID> --output json
nyxid approval revoke-grant <GRANT_ID> --org <ORG_ID> --yes
```

Frontend: the Org detail page has an **Approvals** tab for admins to manage these policies via a UI.

**Cascade semantics** (`approval_service::resolve_org_aware_approval`):

1. If the service being called is **org-owned** and the org has a per-service config row, the org's config wins absolutely. The `notify_user_ids` fan-out goes to every admin of the owning org, and **any** of them can decide.
2. Otherwise, fall back to the **actor's** per-service config for that service.
3. Otherwise, fall back to the actor's **global** approval toggle (`nyxid approval enable/disable`).

When a request is decided by an org admin, the decision is accepted regardless of which admin was the first to receive the notification -- the decide endpoint cross-checks current org admin status as defense-in-depth against admin set changes since the request was created. Grants created by approved org-policy requests live under the **org's** `user_id`, so the next member's call reuses the same grant instead of triggering a second approval.

Audit entries for org-policy-gated decisions include `routed_via: "org"`, `org_user_id`, `member_user_id`, and `policy_owner_user_id: "<org_user_id>"` so it is unambiguous whose policy caused the gate.

- `8106 org_approval_no_admin` -- the org policy on this service requires approval but the org has no active admins; an admin must be added before any member can use the service. Returned as 503 to make the degraded state obvious.

## CLI profiles

For running multiple identities on one machine, the CLI supports `--profile`:

```bash
nyxid login --base-url https://nyx-api.chrono-ai.fun --profile coding-agent
nyxid proxy request llm-openai /chat/completions --profile coding-agent -m POST -d '...'
NYXID_PROFILE=coding-agent nyxid proxy request ...  # or via env var
```

Profiles store tokens under `~/.nyxid/profiles/{name}/`. Without `--profile`, the default `~/.nyxid/` path is used.
