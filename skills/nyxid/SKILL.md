# NyxID

Use NyxID before asking the user to paste raw API keys or OAuth tokens for downstream services.

NyxID is the credential broker. The agent should use the `nyxid` CLI to discover services and make proxy requests. NyxID injects the user's stored credentials automatically.

For the full API reference, error codes, and advanced topics (SSH, MCP, OAuth client integration, service accounts), load `references/playbook.md` or fetch the latest from the NyxID server's `/llms.txt` endpoint.

## Setup

Install the NyxID CLI (one-time):

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChronoAIProject/NyxID/main/skills/nyxid/tools/install.sh)"
```

The installer handles everything: installs Rust if missing, builds the CLI, and configures your shell PATH. Open a new terminal afterwards, then log in:

```bash
nyxid login --base-url https://nyx-api.chrono-ai.fun
```

The CLI stores tokens at `~/.nyxid/` and auto-refreshes them. The base URL is saved on login -- all subsequent commands use it automatically.

> **Registration may require an invite code.** NyxID instances can gate new accounts behind invite codes (controlled by the backend `INVITE_CODE_REQUIRED` env var, default `true`). When enabled, users need a code from an admin and can register via the web UI or the CLI:
>
> ```bash
> nyxid register --base-url https://nyx-api.chrono-ai.fun \
>   --email you@example.com --name "Your Name" \
>   --invite-code NYX-XXXXXXXX
> ```
>
> When the gate is enabled, social login (Google, GitHub, Apple) only works for **existing** users -- first-time social sign-ups are blocked. Users must register with email + invite code first, then link a social provider afterwards by signing in with the same email. When the gate is disabled (public-launch mode), both email registration and first-time social sign-ups work without an invite code.

## Updating

Update the CLI and all installed AI skills in one command:

```bash
nyxid update                                 # update CLI binary + all installed skills
nyxid update --skills-only                   # update only installed skills (skip CLI rebuild)
```

To update a specific tool's skill only:

```bash
nyxid ai-setup update --tool claude-code     # update a specific tool
```

If `nyxid update` is not recognized, your CLI predates this command. Update it first with:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChronoAIProject/NyxID/main/skills/nyxid/tools/install.sh)"
```

## Discover Services

Before using a downstream service, list what the user has configured:

```bash
nyxid service list --output json
```

The response includes:

- `slug`: service identifier for proxy URLs
- `status`: whether the service is active
- `endpoint_url`: where requests are routed
- `node_id`: whether routing through a node agent
- `credential_source`: `{ "type": "personal" }` for the user's own credentials, or `{ "type": "org", "org_id": ..., "org_name": ..., "role": ..., "allowed": ... }` for credentials inherited from an organization the user belongs to. Org-inherited services with `allowed: false` are visible to viewers but cannot be proxied -- do not attempt to call them.

If the target service is missing, help the user add it:

```bash
nyxid catalog list --output json                          # browse available services
nyxid catalog list --all --output json                    # include system services without auth
nyxid catalog show <slug> --output json                   # full metadata: links, capabilities, auth notes
nyxid catalog endpoints <slug>                            # list API endpoints from OpenAPI spec
nyxid service add <slug> --oauth                          # OAuth flow (opens browser -- easiest)
nyxid service add <slug> --device-code                    # device code flow (enter code on website)
nyxid service add <slug>                                  # API key (CLI prompts securely)
nyxid service add --custom                                # add custom endpoint (CLI prompts for details)
```

> For API key services, just run `nyxid service add <slug>` without flags. The CLI securely prompts for the key (input hidden). Never ask the user to paste secrets into chat or set environment variables manually.
> For automation/scripting only: `--credential-env <VAR>` reads from an environment variable.

**Slug rules for `service add`:**

- Lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only. 1-80 characters. No leading, trailing, or consecutive hyphens.
- Slugs are unique **within your own namespace** only -- two users can have services with the same slug without conflict.
- When `--slug` is omitted, NyxID derives the slug from `--label` (or the catalog slug) and appends `-2`, `-3`, ... if you already own one with that name. No random suffixes.
- When `--slug <NAME>` is set and you already own a service with that slug, NyxID returns a **409 Conflict**. The CLI will not silently rename user-supplied slugs -- pick a different slug and retry.

### Requesting additional OAuth scopes

Some OAuth providers (Lark, Google, GitHub, Atlassian, ...) expose many scopes but NyxID's catalog only configures a sensible default set. When a user needs a capability that isn't covered -- for example Lark's contact/attendance APIs -- add extra scopes on top of the defaults with `--scope`:

```bash
# Single scope
nyxid service add api-lark --oauth --scope contact:contact.base:readonly

# Multiple scopes (repeat the flag or comma-separate)
nyxid service add api-lark --oauth \
  --scope contact:contact.base:readonly \
  --scope contact:department.base:readonly

nyxid service add api-lark --oauth \
  --scope "contact:contact.base:readonly,contact:department.base:readonly"

# Works the same way for device-code services
nyxid service add llm-openai --device-code --scope "custom-scope-1,custom-scope-2"
```

The extra scopes are merged (deduped) on top of the provider's `default_scopes` and forwarded in the authorization URL (or device code request). The upstream provider decides whether to grant them -- if the user's app/client doesn't have a scope enabled on the provider side, the authorization flow will still fail there.

**Supported flows:**
- `--oauth` (all OAuth2 providers) -- scopes are appended to the authorization URL.
- `--device-code` (RFC 8628 providers like GitHub, Google, most standard device-code providers) -- scopes are sent in the device code request.
- `--custom` -- `--scope` is accepted for symmetry but has no effect (custom endpoints use direct credentials, not OAuth). The CLI prints a warning.
- OpenAI-format device-code providers (e.g. the seeded `openai-codex` entry) do **not** accept additional scopes -- scopes are baked into the upstream client registration. The backend returns a validation error if you pass `--scope` to one of these, and the "AI Services" UI hides the scope input for them.

In the "AI Services" UI, the OAuth step and the standard device-code step include an optional "Additional scopes" input that accepts the same comma- or space-separated format.

### Scopes with node-routed services (`--via-node`)

Node-routed OAuth flows run on the node agent (so user credentials never leave the node machine). The two-step pattern is:

```bash
# Step 1: On any machine -- create the placeholder record on NyxID. The CLI
# prints the exact next-step command with your scopes pre-filled.
nyxid service add api-lark --oauth --via-node my-node \
  --scope contact:contact.base:readonly,contact:department.base:readonly
# -> "Next step: run this on the node that owns the credential:"
# -> "  nyxid node credentials setup --service api-lark --scope \"contact:contact.base:readonly,contact:department.base:readonly\""

# Step 2: On the node machine -- run the OAuth flow locally with the extras
# merged on top of the catalog's default scopes.
nyxid node credentials setup --service api-lark \
  --scope contact:contact.base:readonly,contact:department.base:readonly
```

`nyxid node credentials add-oauth` also accepts the same `--scope` flag (additive, repeatable) for manual setups. It still accepts the legacy `--scopes` flag (which **replaces** the default scope list entirely) for backward compatibility; prefer `--scope` unless you specifically need override semantics.

## Helping Users Add Services and Credentials

Most users do not know where to find API keys or what authentication method to use. Follow this workflow:

### The new default: CLI → browser wizard

Running `nyxid service add <slug>` with no scripted flags on an interactive TTY now launches a **local browser wizard** (PR #396, wizard v2). This is the recommended flow for non-technical users -- they get the same visual experience as the frontend's Add Key dialog without leaving the terminal to open the web app. End-to-end:

1. User runs `nyxid service add llm-openai` (or with no slug, to pick from the catalog in-wizard).
2. Terminal prints:
   ```
   → Opening http://127.0.0.1:<port>/?csrf=... … (Ctrl-C to cancel)
     Waiting for browser …
   ```
   The CLI boots a local axum server bound to `127.0.0.1:0` (random port, localhost-only), mints a per-session CSRF token, and hands the URL to `open::that` to launch the user's default browser.
3. Browser opens to the wizard SPA -- served entirely from the CLI binary (no remote scripts, strict CSP: `default-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'`). The page inherits the prefill: catalog card pre-selected, label/endpoint/via-node pre-filled from the flags the user typed.
4. User completes the form: picks a catalog service or `--custom`-style custom endpoint, enters credentials (API key / OAuth / device-code all supported in-browser), clicks **"Done — return to terminal"**.
5. CLI rings the terminal bell (`\x07` + OSC-9 attention cue for iTerm2/WezTerm/Kitty) and prints a summary:
   ```
   ✓ Service 'OpenAI' created.
     Slug:      llm-openai
     Proxy URL: https://nyx-api.chrono-ai.fun/api/v1/proxy/s/llm-openai/
     Next:
       curl https://nyx-api.chrono-ai.fun/api/v1/proxy/s/llm-openai/<api-path> -H "Authorization: Bearer $NYX_KEY"
   ```
6. User closes the browser tab (or the tab says "You can close this tab and return to your terminal").

**Safety posture:** everything is local -- the browser never talks to the NyxID backend directly. The wizard's narrow allowlist of endpoints is proxied through the local server with the user's bearer token attached server-side, so the access token never hits the browser. A 10-second heartbeat watchdog cancels the CLI if the browser tab is closed without clicking Done; a 30-minute ceiling catches walked-away tabs.

**Prefill args** (safe to combine with the wizard -- they just seed the form):
the positional catalog slug (e.g. `llm-openai`), `--label`, `--via-node`, `--endpoint-url`. Passing `--slug` bypasses the wizard and runs the scripted terminal flow instead (see the fallback triggers below).

### Wizard transport selection: two predicates, two transports

Before diving into the remote-pairing path below, it's worth making the layering explicit because the skill section above collapses two separate decisions. The wizard code (see `cli/src/wizard/mod.rs`) makes them as follows:

1. **`is_browser_flow_eligible()`** — *"should we use the wizard path at all, vs. the scripted stdin-prompt path?"* Returns `true` when stdin is NOT a TTY (headless), or when both stdin and stdout are TTYs (interactive). Returns `false` only for `TTY stdin + piped stdout` (classic "user scripting output") and for `NYXID_NO_WIZARD=1`.

2. **`is_wizard_eligible()`** — *"inside the wizard path, can we launch a browser on THIS machine?"* Returns `false` on SSH sessions (`SSH_CONNECTION` / `SSH_TTY` set), on Linux without `DISPLAY`/`WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, and with `NYXID_NO_WIZARD=1`.

Inside each wizard runner the two predicates stack as:

```rust
if is_wizard_eligible() {
    // Mode A: launch local axum wizard, `open::that(url)` the browser
} else {
    // Mode B: remote pairing — print code + pair URL, poll for ack
}
```

`open::that()` is the standard Rust wrapper for `open` (macOS), `xdg-open` (Linux), and `start` (Windows) — the same mechanism Lark CLI uses. It means a non-TTY caller that still has a local GUI (macOS agent subprocess, GNOME terminal tab, Windows shell) lands on the **local wizard**, not remote pairing. Remote pairing is reserved for the cases where no local browser can open at all.

Concrete examples of how the layering resolves:

| Environment                                                        | `is_browser_flow_eligible` | `is_wizard_eligible` | Transport                              |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------:|:--------------------:|----------------------------------------|
| macOS agent subprocess (no TTY)                                     | true                       | true                 | **Local wizard** via `open` (macOS)    |
| Linux GUI agent subprocess with `DISPLAY`                           | true                       | true                 | **Local wizard** via `xdg-open`        |
| Windows subprocess, no TTY                                          | true                       | true                 | **Local wizard** via `start`           |
| SSH session (no X forwarding)                                       | true                       | false (SSH_CONNECTION) | **Remote pairing** (code + URL)       |
| Linux CI container / Docker, no `DISPLAY`                           | true                       | false                | **Remote pairing**                     |
| Interactive TTY on any OS                                           | true                       | true                 | **Local wizard**                       |
| Interactive TTY with piped/redirected stdout (`> file`)            | false                      | —                    | Scripted stdin prompts                 |
| `NYXID_NO_WIZARD=1`                                                 | false                      | —                    | Scripted stdin prompts                 |

Guidance for integrators:

- **Users on a GUI machine** (laptop, desktop) always get the local wizard, whether they invoked the CLI from an interactive terminal or from a launcher / IDE that captured stdio.
- **Agents on the user's local machine** (Claude Code / Zed / Codex bash tools, VS Code terminal in an editor window) also get the local wizard — `open`/`xdg-open` opens the user's default browser.
- **Truly remote or headless environments** (SSH from a phone, CI runners, Dockerfile builds, cloud sandboxes) get remote pairing so the user can complete the flow on a separate device.
- To force a specific transport, set `NYXID_NO_WIZARD=1` for the scripted path, or pass `--no-wait` to always use remote pairing.

### When no local browser is available: remote pairing (wizard v4)

Introduced in PR #438 / wizard v4. When the CLI can't launch a local browser (SSH without X11, Docker container, no `DISPLAY` on Linux) — i.e. `is_wizard_eligible()` returns `false` — the wizard is NOT disabled. It transparently switches to a **remote pairing transport**: the CLI prints a short pairing code + a URL on `FRONTEND_URL/cli/pair`, the user opens that URL on any device with a browser (phone, laptop, desktop), logs in, enters the code, and completes the exact same wizard there. The CLI polls and picks up the typed ack. Secrets NEVER transit the CLI — only non-secret identifiers (`service_id`, `slug`, `label`).

End-to-end for an agent:

```bash
# The agent runs the wizard-capable command inside its bash tool. No
# TTY, no local browser — the CLI detects this and prints:
$ nyxid service add llm-openai
  Pair with NyxID to finish:
    1. Open:   https://auth.nyxid.dev/cli/pair?code=ABCD-1234
    2. Enter:  ABCD-1234
  Waiting for browser ... (Ctrl-C to cancel)
```

The agent relays the URL to the user; the user completes the wizard on their own device; the CLI exits with the usual summary. Same works for `api-key create`/`rotate`, `node register-token`/`rotate-token`.

**For agents that can't block on stdout** (streaming tool frameworks), pass `--no-wait` to get a resumable handoff instead:

```bash
# One-shot: print machine-readable pairing info and exit.
nyxid api-key create --name coding-agent --platform claude-code \
  --no-wait --output json
# → { "pairing_id": "pair_…", "code": "ABCD-1234",
#     "pair_url": "https://auth.nyxid.dev/cli/pair?code=ABCD-1234",
#     "resume_cmd": "nyxid pairing resume pair_…",
#     "requires_access_token_on_resume": false,
#     "expires_at": "…" }

# Later, after the user has completed the pair page:
nyxid pairing resume pair_…
```

`--no-wait` also works for agents that DO have a TTY but want an explicit "hand-off and return" semantic.

**Safety posture for remote pairing:** codes are 8 Crockford chars (32^8 ≈ 2^40) stored only as HMAC-SHA256 with a server-side key that never touches MongoDB, user-bound at create time (user A's code cannot be claimed as user B), per-IP rate-limited to 5 claim attempts per 60s on real TCP peer, and expire after 15 min. The backend validates the ack references an actual active UserService before transitioning the pairing to `Completed`, so a malicious / buggy browser page cannot trick the CLI into thinking a placeholder is a connected service.

### When the CLI falls back to terminal (rpassword) mode

Terminal (scripted stdin-prompt) mode is selected when **any** of the following is true:

- `--terminal` (alias `--no-wizard`) is passed on the command line -- **per-invocation override**, useful for a one-off scripted call on a GUI machine.
- `NYXID_NO_WIZARD=1` is set in the environment -- **sticky** across all invocations. Right choice for CI runners, Dockerfiles, and systemd units that want the pre-wizard behavior.
- A **scripted flag** is present (tells the CLI the caller already decided the flow): `--oauth`, `--device-code`, `--credential-env`, `--credential`, `--custom`, `--slug`, `--auth-method`, `--auth-key-name`, `--scope`, `--org`, `--openapi-spec-url`, or `--output json` (unless combined with `--no-wait`, which always uses remote pairing).
- stdin is a TTY **and** stdout is piped / redirected -- the user is clearly scripting output (`nyxid api-key create > key.txt`, `| jq`), so the CLI respects that and uses the stdin-prompt path.

Note: fully-headless environments (agents, SSH without display, CI containers) NO LONGER fall through to stdin-prompt mode. They route through remote pairing (Mode B) or the local wizard (Mode A via `open`/`xdg-open`/`start`) depending on whether a local browser can actually launch — see the transport-selection table above. Set `NYXID_NO_WIZARD=1` to opt out if a caller genuinely wants the stdin-prompt behavior on a headless box (rare — usually means all args are supplied via flags).

Examples:

```bash
# One-off terminal prompt on a GUI machine
nyxid service add llm-openai --terminal

# Sticky opt-out (put in .bashrc, Dockerfile, or systemd Environment=)
NYXID_NO_WIZARD=1 nyxid service add llm-openai

# Scripted flow (auto-falls-through, no flag needed)
nyxid service add llm-openai --credential-env OPENAI_KEY --output json

# Agent: get a pairing URL + resume command for the user
nyxid service add llm-openai --no-wait --output json
```

**Guidance for AI agents using this skill:** prefer scripted flags (`--credential-env`, `--output json`) when the agent already has the credential in hand — this stays fully non-interactive and never touches a browser. When the agent doesn't have the credential (e.g. the user needs to log into an OAuth provider), pass `--no-wait --output json` to print a machine-readable pairing URL the agent can surface to the user, then `nyxid pairing resume <id>` once the user confirms they've completed the browser flow. Agents should NOT rely on `--terminal` without supplying all required args — the scripted path will hang on the first stdin prompt.


### Step 1: Check the catalog

```bash
nyxid catalog show <slug> --output json
```

The response includes `auth_type` which tells you what the service needs. Use this to guide the user.

### Step 2: Choose the right auth flow

- **OAuth** (`--oauth`): Best for non-technical users. Opens a browser -- the user signs in with their existing account. No API key needed. Use this for Google, GitHub, Twitter, and any service that supports OAuth.
  ```bash
  nyxid service add api-github --oauth
  ```

- **Device code** (`--device-code`): Good when the user can't open a browser from the terminal. Shows a short code to enter on the provider's website. Works well for services like OpenAI Codex.
  ```bash
  nyxid service add llm-openai --device-code
  ```

- **API key**: The user needs to get an API key from the provider's website. Guide them:
  1. Check the common portals table below for the provider's developer portal URL
  2. If the provider is not listed, search the web for "<provider name> API key" to find the right page, then tell the user exactly where to go
  3. Walk them through creating a key on the provider's site
  4. Tell them to run the command **without** `--credential-env` -- the CLI will securely prompt for the key (input is hidden, never shown on screen):
     ```bash
     nyxid service add llm-openai
     # CLI prompts: "Enter API key/credential:" (input hidden)
     ```
  Never ask the user to paste secrets into chat. The CLI's secure prompt keeps the key out of shell history and conversation logs.

### Step 3: Common provider portals

When users need API keys, direct them to the right place:

| Service | Where to get the key | Env var example |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| OpenAI | https://platform.openai.com/api-keys | `OPENAI_KEY` |
| Anthropic | https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys | `ANTHROPIC_KEY` |
| GitHub | https://github.com/settings/tokens | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| Google Cloud | https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials | `GOOGLE_KEY` |
| Groq | https://console.groq.com/keys | `GROQ_KEY` |

For services not listed here, check `nyxid catalog show <slug> --output json` for the provider's documentation URL.

### Tips for non-technical users

- **Prefer `--oauth` or `--device-code`** over API keys whenever available -- the user just signs in.
- **Explain what an API key is**: "It's like a password that lets NyxID call the service on your behalf. You create it once and NyxID stores it securely."
- **Environment variables are temporary**: `export VAR="value"` only lasts for the current terminal session. The credential is stored in NyxID after `service add`, so the env var is only needed once.
- If the user is confused, break it into smaller steps. For example: "First, let's check what services are available" then `nyxid catalog list`.

## Make Proxy Requests

NyxID proxies requests to downstream services -- it handles authentication, but you need to
know the correct API paths, methods, and body formats for each service.

### How to find the right API paths

NyxID is just a proxy. The paths, methods, and request bodies are the same as calling
the downstream service directly. To figure out what to send:

1. Check catalog for endpoints: `nyxid catalog endpoints <slug>`
   - If the service has an OpenAPI spec, this returns all available endpoints (method, path, description)
2. Check the catalog for documentation: `nyxid catalog show <slug> --output json`
   - Look for `homepage_url`, `repository_url`, `documentation_url` -- links to docs and source
   - Check `capabilities` to understand supported interaction patterns
   - Check `auth_notes` and `known_limitations` for caveats
3. If no documentation URL is available, **search the web** for "<service name> API documentation"
   (e.g., "OpenAI API documentation", "Twitter API v2 documentation")
4. Use the provider's docs to determine the correct path, method, headers, and body format
5. Use `-H "Content-Type: ..."` if the service expects something other than JSON

### Important: paths are relative to the service's base URL

Each service in NyxID has a configured `endpoint_url` (base URL) that may already include
a version prefix. For example, `api-twitter` uses `https://api.x.com/2` as its base URL.
When making a proxy request, the path you provide is appended to that base URL:

- Service base URL: `https://api.x.com/2`
- Your path: `/tweets`
- Actual request: `https://api.x.com/2/tweets`

So do NOT duplicate the version prefix in your path. Check `nyxid service show <id> --output json`
to see the `endpoint_url` if you're unsure.

### Making the request

```bash
nyxid proxy request <slug> <path> -m <METHOD> -d '<body>'

# Custom content type (default is application/json)
nyxid proxy request <slug> <path> -m POST -H "Content-Type: application/xml" -d '<xml>...</xml>'

# Stream responses (SSE, video, audio, large files)
nyxid proxy request <slug> <path> -m POST --stream -d '<body>'

# Read body from file (uploads up to 100 MB supported on proxy routes)
nyxid proxy request <slug> <path> -m POST -d @request.json

# Read body from stdin
echo '{"prompt":"hello"}' | nyxid proxy request <slug> <path> -m POST -d -

# Explicit credential selection: when the user has both a personal and
# an org credential for the same slug, use --via-service to pick which
# one the proxy uses. Get the UserService ID from `nyxid service list`.
nyxid proxy request <slug> <path> -m POST --via-service <USER_SERVICE_ID> -d '<body>'
```

### Calling NyxID from raw HTTP (no CLI)

The CLI is a thin wrapper over the NyxID HTTP API. If you're integrating
from a service where installing the CLI isn't practical -- an automation
runtime, a webhook handler, another language -- call the proxy endpoint
directly. The only Authorization header the client sends is its own
**NyxID** bearer token; NyxID handles every downstream credential
(Lark `tenant_access_token`, OpenAI API key, GitHub PAT, etc.) entirely
server-side.

**Proxy endpoint shapes:**

| Path | When to use |
|---|---|
| `POST/GET/... /api/v1/proxy/s/{slug}/{path}` | Slug-based, most common |
| `POST/GET/... /api/v1/proxy/{user_service_id}/{path}` | UUID-based, when you already have the id from `GET /api/v1/keys` |
| `...?_nyxid_via=<user_service_id>` | Optional query param on either path. Bypasses auto-resolution and uses the specified UserService directly. The selected UserService must match the route's slug or service_id (returns 400 otherwise). Useful when both personal and org credentials exist for the same slug. Stripped before forwarding to downstream. |

**Example -- send a Lark message as a bot (no Lark token management):**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://nyx-api.chrono-ai.fun/api/v1/proxy/s/api-lark-bot/open-apis/im/v1/messages?receive_id_type=chat_id" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <nyxid_access_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
  -d '{"receive_id":"oc_xxx","msg_type":"text","content":"{\"text\":\"hello\"}"}'
```

What happens server-side on that single request:

1. NyxID auth middleware validates `<nyxid_access_token>` and resolves the user.
2. Proxy handler looks up the user's `api-lark-bot` binding and loads the catalog `token_exchange_config`.
3. NyxID checks its in-process cache for this user's Lark `tenant_access_token`. Hit: jump to step 5.
4. Cache miss: NyxID decrypts `{app_id, app_secret}`, POSTs to Lark's `/auth/v3/tenant_access_token/internal` server-to-server (single-flight per app, so concurrent misses coalesce), caches the result (~2h TTL with 10-min safety margin).
5. NyxID strips the client's Authorization header, injects `Authorization: Bearer <tenant_access_token>` on the outbound request, and forwards to Lark.
6. Lark's response is returned to the client unchanged.

**Same pattern for any other service** -- OpenAI, GitHub, Twitter, etc. The client only ever sends its NyxID bearer; NyxID injects the downstream credential for each service according to the service's `auth_method` (bearer, header, body, token_exchange, ...).

**Obtaining the NyxID bearer token:**

- **Interactive user:** `POST /api/v1/auth/login` returns a short-lived access token (~15 min) and a refresh token (~7 days). Refresh via `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh`.
- **Service / agent:** provision a NyxID API key via `nyxid api-key create --platform <your-platform>` and use it directly as `Authorization: Bearer nyxid_ag_...`. API keys don't expire unless rotated.

**Things the client must NOT send:**

- A second `Authorization` header intended for the downstream (e.g. a Lark `tenant_access_token`). The allowlist strips any forwarded Authorization header by design, and raw HTTP clients that append instead of replace (reqwest's `RequestBuilder::header`, some JVM clients) would put duplicate Authorization lines on the wire and hit Cloudflare 400 at the edge. Let NyxID inject the downstream Authorization header.
- Downstream credentials (API keys, app secrets, tokens) in the request body or query string. NyxID already has them encrypted at rest and injects them according to the service's `auth_method`.

### Common service examples

Paths below are relative to each service's base URL. Check `nyxid service show <id> --output json`
for the `endpoint_url` if unsure.

```bash
# OpenAI (base: https://api.openai.com/v1) -- POST /chat/completions
nyxid proxy request llm-openai /chat/completions -m POST \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'

# Anthropic (base: https://api.anthropic.com/v1) -- POST /messages
nyxid proxy request llm-anthropic /messages -m POST \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -d '{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-20250514","max_tokens":1024,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'

# GitHub API (base: https://api.github.com) -- GET /user/repos
nyxid proxy request api-github /user/repos -m GET

# Twitter / X (base: https://api.x.com/2) -- POST /tweets (not /2/tweets!)
nyxid proxy request api-twitter /tweets -m POST \
  -d '{"text":"Hello from NyxID"}'

# Discover all available proxy services
nyxid proxy discover --output json
```

NyxID injects the user's credentials automatically. Do not ask for or log raw downstream credentials.

### WebSocket-authenticated services

Some protocols (Home Assistant, Discord gateway, MQTT-over-WS, Slack RTM) do not accept the credential on the HTTP upgrade. They complete the upgrade unauthenticated, send a challenge frame, then expect a response frame carrying the credential. NyxID can inject a held credential into that response frame on the client's behalf -- the client never sees the challenge.

From an agent's point of view, this is a normal WS proxy call with only the NyxID bearer:

```python
import asyncio, json, os, websockets

async def main():
    async with websockets.connect(
        "wss://nyx-api.chrono-ai.fun/api/v1/proxy/s/home-assistant/websocket",
        additional_headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ['NYXID_ACCESS_TOKEN']}"},
    ) as ws:
        # First visible frame is auth_ok -- the auth_required challenge was
        # consumed by NyxID and never reached this client.
        print(await ws.recv())
        await ws.send(json.dumps({"id": 1, "type": "get_states"}))
        print(await ws.recv())

asyncio.run(main())
```

Or with `websocat`:

```bash
websocat -H="Authorization: Bearer $NYXID_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  "wss://nyx-api.chrono-ai.fun/api/v1/proxy/s/home-assistant/websocket"
```

**Home Assistant preset.** The admin service-edit dashboard has a one-click Home Assistant preset in the "WebSocket auth frames" section. It installs this rule on the catalog entry so every user whose `UserService` is catalog-backed inherits it automatically:

```json
{
  "trigger": {"json_field_equals": {"path": "$.type", "value": "auth_required"}},
  "template": "{\"type\":\"auth\",\"access_token\":\"${credential}\"}",
  "frame_kind": "text",
  "consume_trigger": true,
  "direction": "downstream"
}
```

Expected on-wire behavior:

```text
Downstream -> NyxID:    {"type":"auth_required","ha_version":"..."}
NyxID -> Downstream:    {"type":"auth","access_token":"<held credential>"}
Downstream -> Client:   {"type":"auth_ok"}
```

With `consume_trigger: true` the client's first visible frame is `auth_ok`, not `auth_required`. The credential substitution for `${credential}` uses the service's held LLAT (or bearer); the client only ever sends its NyxID bearer.

**Admins: configure via REST.** `ws_frame_injections` is an admin-only field today. `nyxid service update` does not yet expose it, and user-owned custom endpoints cannot set it through the user API. Admins configure catalog entries via the dashboard or directly:

```bash
# Requires admin role on the bearer
curl -X PUT "https://nyx-api.chrono-ai.fun/api/v1/services/$SERVICE_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ws_frame_injections":[{
    "trigger":{"json_field_equals":{"path":"$.type","value":"auth_required"}},
    "template":"{\"type\":\"auth\",\"access_token\":\"${credential}\"}",
    "frame_kind":"text",
    "consume_trigger":true,
    "direction":"downstream"
  }]}'
```

**Other WS protocols.** The same pattern covers any challenge/response post-upgrade auth. Only Home Assistant has a built-in preset today; others need the rule hand-written.

| Protocol | Challenge shape | Response template |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Home Assistant | `{"type":"auth_required"}` text frame | `{"type":"auth","access_token":"${credential}"}` |
| Discord gateway | op:10 Hello text frame | op:2 IDENTIFY with the bot token |
| MQTT-over-WS CONNECT | binary CONNECT packet | binary CONNECT with username/password |

Binary frame triggers are supported via `"frame_kind": "binary"`, but `json_field_equals` only evaluates text frames -- use `first_frame_from_downstream` or `frame_index_from_downstream` for binary protocols.

**Limits.** Max 4 rules per service, 4 KB per template, 8 injections per WS connection. `${credential}` is the only supported template interpolation. Credentials never appear in logs, errors, or audit payloads -- the proxy only records a 12-hex-char SHA-256 prefix for correlation. Successful injection emits the metadata-only audit event `ws_frame_auth_injected`. See `docs/WS_FRAME_INJECTION.md` for the full schema.

## Managing Services

```bash
nyxid catalog list                                             # browse catalog (connectable services)
nyxid catalog list --all                                       # all services (including system/no-auth)
nyxid catalog endpoints <slug>                                 # list API endpoints from OpenAPI spec
nyxid service add <slug>                                       # add from catalog (CLI prompts for credential)
nyxid service add <slug> --oauth                               # add with OAuth (opens browser)
nyxid service add <slug> --device-code                         # add with device code flow
nyxid service add <slug> --via-node <name>                     # add via node (CLI prompts for credential)
nyxid service add --custom                                     # add custom endpoint (CLI prompts for details)
nyxid service list --output json                               # list services (includes IDs)
nyxid service show <id>                                        # show service details
nyxid service update <id> --label "My Custom Name"             # rename service
nyxid service update <id> --openapi-spec-url https://api.example.com/openapi.json  # attach an OpenAPI spec
nyxid service update <id> --openapi-spec-url ""                # clear the OpenAPI spec URL
nyxid service update <id> --default-header 'x-openclaw-scopes=operator.read,operator.write'
nyxid service update <id> --default-header 'x-api-version=v2:overridable'
nyxid service update <id> --default-header 'x-secret-token=abc123:sensitive'   # redact value in audit logs / API responses
nyxid service update <id> --clear-default-headers
nyxid service delete <id> --yes                                # remove service (no prompt)
```

> Default request header precedence is `catalog defaults -> UserService defaults -> caller`. The default is non-overridable unless `:overridable` is set on the value.

> Node commands accept names (e.g., `--via-node test-server`) in addition to UUIDs.

### Attaching an OpenAPI spec to a custom endpoint

Custom endpoints default to a single generic proxy tool. If the target service publishes an OpenAPI spec, attach the spec URL so AI agents (MCP, `/api/v1/endpoints/{id}/openapi-endpoints`) surface one tool per operation instead. Catalog-backed services inherit the catalog entry's spec URL automatically -- pass an empty string (`--openapi-spec-url ""`) on create if you want to opt out.

```bash
# Custom endpoint with OpenAPI discovery
nyxid service add --custom --label "My API" \
  --endpoint-url https://api.example.com/v1 \
  --openapi-spec-url https://api.example.com/openapi.json \
  --credential-env MY_API_TOKEN

# Pick a custom slug instead of letting NyxID derive one from --label
nyxid service add --custom --slug home-assistant --label "Home Assistant" \
  --endpoint-url https://ha.local:8123/api \
  --credential-env HA_TOKEN

# `--slug` also works on catalog-backed keys for running multiple instances
nyxid service add llm-openai --slug llm-openai-prod --credential-env OPENAI_PROD_KEY
nyxid service add llm-openai --slug llm-openai-staging --credential-env OPENAI_STAGING_KEY

# `--slug` also works with OAuth and device-code flows
nyxid service add api-lark --oauth --slug lark-team-engineering

# Catalog-backed key that suppresses the catalog's default spec URL
nyxid service add llm-openai --openapi-spec-url ""

# Attach or update the spec URL after the fact
nyxid service update <id> --openapi-spec-url https://api.example.com/openapi.json
```

URLs must be `http(s)://` and cannot contain `user:pass@` userinfo. The backend fetches them through a hardened path (DNS pinning, 5 MB size cap, no redirects, per-user cache scoping) and falls back to the generic proxy tool if the spec can't be fetched or parsed, so a broken spec URL never takes the service offline. SSH services ignore this field.

## Managing API Keys

Each AI agent or integration should use its own NyxID API key (agent key). This gives each caller independent audit trail, optional service bindings, and rate limits.

```bash
# CRUD
nyxid api-key create                                       # interactive: opens scope-picker wizard (v3.1)
nyxid api-key create --name "My Key" --scopes "proxy read"
nyxid api-key create --name "coding-agent" --platform claude-code  # any prefill flag is picked up by the wizard
nyxid api-key create --name "relay-agent" --callback-url "https://..."  # for channel bot relay
nyxid api-key create --name "My Key" --output json         # scripted: prints raw key to stdout (legacy shape)
nyxid api-key list --output json
nyxid api-key show <ID_OR_NAME> --output json
nyxid api-key rotate <ID_OR_NAME>                          # interactive: opens browser wizard
nyxid api-key rotate <ID_OR_NAME> --output json            # scripted: prints raw secret to stdout (legacy shape)
nyxid api-key delete <ID_OR_NAME> --yes

# Org-owned agent keys (for sharing one agent identity across the whole org)
nyxid api-key create --name "shared-coding-agent" --org <ORG_ID> --platform claude-code
nyxid api-key list --org <ORG_ID>                     # list all keys owned by this org
nyxid api-key rotate <ID> --output json               # any org admin can rotate
nyxid api-key delete <ID> --yes                       # any org admin can delete

# Consumers authenticate as the org: the agent's NYXID_ACCESS_TOKEN is the
# org's key, proxy calls see org-shared services directly without needing
# membership resolution, and audit logs attribute requests to the key
# (not the admin who created it).

# Service bindings (credential auto-resolved from service)
nyxid api-key bind <ID_OR_NAME> --service <SERVICE_SLUG>
nyxid api-key bind <ID_OR_NAME> --service <SLUG> --credential <LABEL>  # explicit override

# By default, agents can access all services with default credentials.
# Bindings override which credential is used for specific services.
# To restrict an agent to ONLY access bound services:
nyxid api-key update <ID> --allow-all-services false

# Callback URL for channel bot relay
nyxid api-key update <ID> --callback-url "https://my-agent.example.com/webhook"
nyxid api-key update <ID> --callback-url ""    # clear

# Per-key rate limits
nyxid api-key update <ID> --rate-limit-per-second 10 --rate-limit-burst 30
```

Set `NYXID_ACCESS_TOKEN` in your agent's environment to authenticate:

```bash
export NYXID_ACCESS_TOKEN="nyxid_ag_..."
```

### Scope requirements for management writes

Agent keys need `write` or `admin` scope to call management endpoints via REST (create/update/delete/rotate API keys, services, endpoints, bindings, etc.). `proxy read` is sufficient for proxy traffic only -- paths under `/proxy`, `/llm`, `/ssh`, `/channel-events`, `/channel-relay`, and `/delegation` do not require write scope. The `nyxid` CLI uses session auth (not API keys) and is unaffected.

### Browser wizard for one-time secrets (v2 + v3.0 + v3.1 + v4)

Five commands now open a browser-based wizard for interactive use, so the secret (either collected from the user or minted by the backend) lands in the user's browser tab instead of the terminal / agent context:

| Command                           | Version | Wizard role                                                                                            |
|-----------------------------------|:-------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `nyxid service add [<slug>]`      |   v2    | Collects a paste-key / OAuth / device-code credential; creates the service + key record.               |
| `nyxid api-key rotate <id>`       |   v3.0  | DisplayOnce: backend mints a new `nyxid_ag_…`, rendered masked with click-to-reveal + copy.            |
| `nyxid node rotate-token <id>`    |   v3.0  | DisplayOnce: backend mints a new auth token + signing secret (two rows).                               |
| `nyxid node register-token`       |   v3.1  | DisplayOnce: backend mints a new `nyx_nreg_…` for bootstrapping a fresh node.                          |
| `nyxid api-key create`            |   v3.1  | Scope picker (name + owner + platform + scopes + expiry + service/node multi-select + rate limits) → DisplayOnce on the new `nyxid_ag_…`. |

All five commands automatically pick between two transports depending on environment, added in v4 (PR #438):

- **Mode A — Local wizard** (v2/v3 original): picked when `is_wizard_eligible()` returns `true`, i.e. the CLI can launch a local browser via `open::that()` (macOS `open`, Linux `xdg-open`, Windows `start`). The CLI boots an axum server on `127.0.0.1:<random-port>`, opens the wizard SPA there, and the browser talks back through a narrow allowlist of proxied endpoints. Access tokens never hit the browser; 10-second heartbeat cancels on tab-close. CLI prints `→ Opening http://127.0.0.1:…/wizard …`. This is the path taken **on any machine with a desktop environment**, including non-TTY agent subprocesses on macOS / Windows / Linux-with-DISPLAY — the subprocess not having a TTY doesn't prevent `open` / `xdg-open` / `start` from reaching the user's default browser.

- **Mode B — Remote pairing** (v4 new): picked when `is_wizard_eligible()` returns `false`, which only happens on SSH sessions (`SSH_CONNECTION` / `SSH_TTY` set), Linux boxes without `DISPLAY`/`WAYLAND_DISPLAY` (CI runners, headless containers), or when `NYXID_NO_WIZARD=1` is set. The CLI creates a short-lived server-side pairing record and prints a pair URL + 8-char Crockford code on `FRONTEND_URL/cli/pair`. The user opens the URL on ANY device with a browser (phone, desktop), logs in, enters the code, and completes the same wizard there. The CLI polls for the typed ack. Same visual experience, same DisplayOnce affordances.

The selection is automatic — callers don't need to pick. The only caller-facing knob is `--no-wait`, which forces Mode B regardless of `is_wizard_eligible()` because it's designed for agent wrappers that want a resumable handoff instead of blocking on a live wizard.

Full specs: [`docs/CLI_WIZARD_V2.md`](../../docs/CLI_WIZARD_V2.md) (v2) + [`docs/CLI_WIZARD_V3.md`](../../docs/CLI_WIZARD_V3.md) (v3 / v3.1). v4's pairing transport lives under `/cli-pairings/*` backend endpoints and `/cli/pair` on the frontend.

**Visual consistency.** Both transports share the same shell: same brand lockup (NyxID wordmark in DM Serif Display), same ✓/✗/⚠ overlay system, same purple accent (`#8b5cf6` / `#7c3aed`), same button and field styling. The local path's footer says "Served locally from 127.0.0.1 · Nothing leaves your machine"; the remote path omits that footer because the page is served from the NyxID frontend origin — but secrets still never leave the browser (the CLI receives only non-secret identifiers via the pairing ack).

**Agent handoff with `--no-wait`.** For agents that can't block on the pairing URL streaming out of stdout, every wizard-capable command accepts `--no-wait`: the CLI creates the pairing, prints a JSON payload on stdout with `{pairing_id, code, pair_url, resume_cmd, requires_access_token_on_resume, expires_at}`, and exits 0 immediately. The agent relays `pair_url` to the user and later runs the printed `resume_cmd` (or `nyxid pairing resume <pairing_id>`) to pick up the result. `--no-wait` works regardless of TTY state.

For scripted / agent use, the wizard is **bypassed** (falls through to the pre-wizard stdin / rpassword path) when ANY of these is true:

- `--terminal` (alias `--no-wizard`) is passed — per-invocation override, available on all five wizard commands.
- `NYXID_NO_WIZARD=1` is set in the environment.
- `--output json` is passed AND `--no-wait` is NOT — agents that want machine-readable output stay scripted, unless they explicitly opt into the pairing transport via `--no-wait`.
- stdin is a TTY AND stdout is piped / redirected — the user is scripting output but has an interactive shell for prompts.

Note: having no TTY at all (agent subprocess, SSH without X11, CI container) does NOT bypass — the command routes through remote pairing instead, since a scripted stdin prompt would just hang. Set `NYXID_NO_WIZARD=1` explicitly if a caller wants the scripted path on a headless box.

When the wizard is bypassed the commands print the raw secret to stdout in the same shape as the pre-wizard CLI. Agents calling these commands programmatically have three clean options:

- `--output json --credential-env VAR` or other scripted flags → fully non-interactive, no browser or pairing involved.
- `--no-wait --output json` → machine-readable pairing URL + resume command; agent relays the URL to the user.
- `--terminal` with all args supplied → pre-wizard scripted prompts skipped because every prompt has a flag value.

Behavior change to be aware of: `nyxid api-key rotate <name>` now **refuses ambiguous names** — if multiple keys share the same name, the command exits with `Name 'X' matches N keys. Pass the ID instead.` Previously it silently rotated the first match (which could rotate the wrong key). Always prefer ID over name for scripted rotation.

Rotation is **server-atomic** in both modes: the old key is deactivated and a new key is created with a new ID, preserving name + scopes + bindings. Anything that hard-codes the old ID (CI configs, dashboards, prior bindings registered out-of-band) will need updating to the new ID. Existing `AgentServiceBinding` records are cloned to the new key automatically.

## Organizations (Shared Credentials)

NyxID supports **organizations** for sharing a single set of credentials across multiple users. The classic example is a family Home Assistant or a company OpenAI key: one credential record, many people calling it through their own NyxID accounts. The proxy automatically falls back to org credentials when a personal one is missing for the requested service, with full per-member audit attribution.

### Mental model

- An **org is just a special user** (`user_type: "org"`) that cannot log in directly. It owns its own services, endpoints, API keys, etc., the same way a person does.
- **Membership** lives in `org_memberships`. Each member has a **role** (`admin` / `member` / `viewer`) and an optional service-id scope. Admins manage everything; members can use org services through the proxy; viewers can see them in `nyxid service list` but cannot proxy through them.
- **Resolution priority:** when a proxy request comes in, NyxID first looks for a personal `UserService` matching the slug. Only if that misses does it walk the user's active memberships (in `primary_org_id` order, then earliest-joined) and try the org's services. Personal credentials always win.
- **`credential_source` on `nyxid service list`**: every service in the response is tagged with `{ "type": "personal" }` or `{ "type": "org", "org_id": ..., "org_name": ..., "role": ..., "allowed": ... }`. Use this to tell the user which credentials are theirs vs. shared.

### Creating and managing an org

```bash
# Create an org. You become the first admin.
nyxid org create --display-name "Chrono AI"

# List all orgs you belong to
nyxid org list

# Show details (member count, your role)
nyxid org show <ORG_ID>

# Update metadata (admin only). Pass --avatar-url "" to clear.
nyxid org update <ORG_ID> --display-name "New Name"

# Delete (admin only). Refuses if the org still owns any shared services,
# endpoints, API keys, or NyxID API keys -- transfer or delete those first.
nyxid org delete <ORG_ID> --yes
```

### Sharing a service with the org

An org admin creates a shared service by passing `--org <ORG_ID>` to `nyxid service add`. The resulting `UserService`, `UserEndpoint`, and `UserApiKey` rows are written with `user_id = <org_user_id>`, so every member of the org immediately sees the service in their `nyxid service list` (tagged with `credential_source.type = "org"`) and can proxy through it using their own NyxID account.

```bash
# Shared OpenAI key for the whole org (API key credential)
nyxid service add llm-openai --org 1c3f8e2a-...

# OAuth flow targeted at the org. The browser opens under YOUR login, you
# grant access to the org's copy of the provider, and the resulting token
# is stored under the org's user_id so every member can proxy through it.
nyxid service add api-google --oauth --org 1c3f8e2a-...

# Device-code flow targeted at the org
nyxid service add llm-anthropic --device-code --org 1c3f8e2a-...

# Custom endpoint targeted at the org
nyxid service add --custom --org 1c3f8e2a-... \
  --label "Shared Home Assistant" \
  --endpoint-url https://ha.home.local:8123 \
  --auth-method bearer

# Node-routed shared service. The credential lives on the admin's
# personal node (encrypted at rest there) but the org service points
# at it. Every org member's proxy calls flow: NyxID -> admin's node ->
# downstream API. The admin must have write access to the node (which
# they do because it's their personal node); the node itself does not
# need to be re-registered under the org.
nyxid service add llm-openai --org 1c3f8e2a-... --via-node my-laptop-node
# Then on the node:
nyxid node credentials setup --service llm-openai
```

The backend enforces that the caller is an admin of the target org before writing the row (returns `8103 org_role_insufficient` otherwise). Creating or updating an org-owned service respects the membership's `allowed_service_ids` scope just like the proxy path.

> **How org-OAuth works under the hood.** The CLI creates a placeholder `UserApiKey` under the org's user_id (`POST /keys` with `target_org_id`), then initiates the OAuth / device-code flow with `target_org_id=X` on the query string. The backend stores the resulting `UserProviderToken` with `user_id = org`, and the sync routine matches it to the placeholder because both share the same user_id. The admin's personal scope is untouched -- the grant lives entirely under the org. If you prefer a dedicated identity for the org's OAuth grants (so personal account compromise does not leak the org credential), create a dedicated service account and use its token for the initial `nyxid login` before running `nyxid service add ... --oauth --org <X>`.

> Viewer-role members still see org services in the list (tagged `credential_source.allowed = false`) but cannot click into their detail page or proxy through them. Scoped members only see services within their `allowed_service_ids` scope -- services outside the scope are hidden entirely, not just disabled.

The frontend `/keys` page groups personal vs. each org section, with viewer-role and out-of-scope items rendered read-only.

### Inviting members

```bash
# Issue a one-time invite (admin only). Default role is member, default TTL 24h.
nyxid org invite create <ORG_ID> --role member
nyxid org invite create <ORG_ID> --role viewer --ttl-hours 168

# Restrict the invitee to specific UserService IDs (comma-separated)
nyxid org invite create <ORG_ID> --role member --allowed-service-ids "<svc1>,<svc2>"

# The output includes a join link AND a bare nonce. Share whichever is convenient:
#   Join link: https://<frontend>/orgs/join/ORGINV-...
#   CLI:       nyxid org join ORGINV-...

# Recipient redeems while signed in
nyxid org join ORGINV-ABCDEF12345678
nyxid org join "https://nyx.example.com/orgs/join/ORGINV-..."   # full URL also works

# List or cancel pending invites
nyxid org invite list <ORG_ID>
nyxid org invite cancel <ORG_ID> <INVITE_ID> --yes
```

Direct add (without an invite) is also available for tooling but not recommended:

```bash
nyxid org member add <ORG_ID> --user-id <USER_ID> --role member
```

### Managing members

```bash
# List members of an org (any member can read)
nyxid org member list <ORG_ID>

# Change a member's role or scope (admin only)
nyxid org member update <ORG_ID> <MEMBER_USER_ID> --role admin
nyxid org member update <ORG_ID> <MEMBER_USER_ID> --allowed-service-ids "<svc1>,<svc2>"
nyxid org member update <ORG_ID> <MEMBER_USER_ID> --allowed-service-ids ""    # clear scope

# Remove a member (admin only). Re-adding later reactivates the same membership row.
nyxid org member remove <ORG_ID> <MEMBER_USER_ID> --yes
```

### Multi-org tiebreaker: `primary_org_id`

When a user belongs to multiple orgs that all happen to share the same service slug, the proxy needs a deterministic winner. The default is the earliest-joined org. To override:

```bash
nyxid org set-primary --org-id <ORG_ID>      # set
nyxid org set-primary --clear                # unset (revert to earliest-joined)
```

### Working with org services in agents

For an AI agent making proxy requests, **nothing changes by default**. The agent calls `nyxid proxy request <slug> ...` exactly as before. NyxID looks up the credential -- personal first, then org -- and injects it. The audit log records `routed_via: "personal"` or `routed_via: "org"` (with `org_user_id` and `member_user_id`) so the org admin can see who used what.

If the user has both a personal and an org credential for the same slug and wants to explicitly choose which one the proxy uses, pass `--via-service <USER_SERVICE_ID>`:

```bash
# List services to see both personal and org entries with their IDs
nyxid service list --output json

# Use the org credential explicitly (bypasses personal-first auto-resolution)
nyxid proxy request llm-openai /chat/completions -m POST \
  --via-service <ORG_USER_SERVICE_ID> \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
```

The `?_nyxid_via=` param is stripped before forwarding to the downstream service, so the downstream never sees NyxID routing metadata.

When listing services for the user, **always print the `credential_source` field** so the user can tell which credentials are theirs and which are shared. Viewer-role items have `credential_source.allowed = false`; do not attempt to proxy through them -- the request will return `8103 org_role_insufficient`.

### Org-level approval policies

An org admin can require approval whenever any member uses a specific org-owned service. Unlike personal per-service configs, **the org policy is dominant**: it overrides the member's personal approval gate for that service.

```bash
# Set an org policy: every member must get an admin's approval before
# their proxy call through this org service goes through. Per-request mode.
nyxid approval set-config <SERVICE_ID> --org <ORG_ID> --require-approval true

# Same but use time-based grant mode (approval creates a reusable grant)
nyxid approval set-config <SERVICE_ID> --org <ORG_ID> --require-approval true --approval-mode grant

# List current org-level policies on org-owned services
nyxid approval service-configs --org <ORG_ID> --output json

# List approval requests filed against org services (admin-only view)
nyxid approval list --org <ORG_ID> --output json

# List active grants created from org-policy approvals (grant mode only).
# These live under the org's user_id, so this is the only way for admins
# to see / revoke them.
nyxid approval grants --org <ORG_ID> --output json
nyxid approval revoke-grant <GRANT_ID> --org <ORG_ID> --yes
```

Frontend: the Org detail page has an **Approvals** tab for admins to manage these policies via a UI.

**Cascade semantics** (`approval_service::resolve_org_aware_approval`):

1. If the service being called is **org-owned** and the org has a per-service config row, the org's config wins absolutely. The `notify_user_ids` fan-out goes to every admin of the owning org, and **any** of them can decide.
2. Otherwise, fall back to the **actor's** per-service config for that service.
3. Otherwise, fall back to the actor's **global** approval toggle (`nyxid approval enable/disable`).

When a request is decided by an org admin, the decision is accepted regardless of which admin was the first to receive the notification -- the decide endpoint cross-checks current org admin status as defense-in-depth against admin set changes since the request was created. Grants created by approved org-policy requests live under the **org's** `user_id`, so the next member's call reuses the same grant instead of triggering a second approval.

Audit entries for org-policy-gated decisions include `routed_via: "org"`, `org_user_id`, `member_user_id`, and `policy_owner_user_id: "<org_user_id>"` so it is unambiguous whose policy caused the gate.

### CLI profiles

For running multiple identities on one machine, the CLI supports `--profile`:

```bash
nyxid login --base-url https://nyx-api.chrono-ai.fun --profile coding-agent
nyxid proxy request llm-openai /chat/completions --profile coding-agent -m POST -d '...'
NYXID_PROFILE=coding-agent nyxid proxy request ...  # or via env var
```

Profiles store tokens under `~/.nyxid/profiles/{name}/`. Without `--profile`, the default `~/.nyxid/` path is used.

## Node Management

Nodes are for users who do not want their credentials stored on the NyxID server. Instead, credentials stay encrypted on the user's own machine (the node). When a proxy request comes in, NyxID passes it through to the node agent via WebSocket, the node injects the credential locally and forwards the request to the downstream service. The credential never leaves the node.

### Setting up a new node

Registration must happen before installing the daemon. Credentials can be added before or after starting -- the agent reloads them automatically within 5 seconds.

```bash
# Step 1: Generate a registration token (on any machine with nyxid CLI)
nyxid node register-token

# Step 2: Install nyxid CLI on the target machine
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChronoAIProject/NyxID/main/skills/nyxid/tools/install.sh)"

# Step 3: Register the node (--keychain recommended for secure storage)
nyxid node register \
  --token "nyx_nreg_..." \
  --url "wss://<server>/api/v1/nodes/ws" \
  --keychain

# Step 4: Install and start as a background service (recommended)
nyxid node daemon install                              # install as system service
nyxid node daemon start                                # start the service

# Step 5: Add credentials (auto-registers catalog services in the backend)
nyxid node credentials setup --service llm-openai      # agent picks up new credentials automatically

# For custom endpoints: register first, then add credentials locally
nyxid service add --custom --via-node my-node           # creates backend record (prompts for URL, auth, etc.)
nyxid node credentials add --service my-api --header Authorization --secret-format bearer

# Or run in foreground (for debugging)
nyxid node start

# Or run via Docker
docker build -f cli/Dockerfile.node -t nyxid-node .    # build image (once)

# Option A: auto-register + start (no host setup needed)
docker run --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  -v ~/.nyxid-node:/app/config \
  -e NYXID_NODE_TOKEN=nyx_nreg_... \
  -e NYXID_NODE_URL=wss://<server>/api/v1/nodes/ws \
  nyxid-node

# Option B: mount existing config (registered on host)
docker run --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  -v ~/.nyxid-node:/app/config \
  nyxid-node
```

> `credentials setup` works for **catalog services only** -- it fetches config from the catalog and automatically registers the service in the backend with the node's ID.
> For **custom endpoints**, use `nyxid service add --custom --via-node <node-name>` first to create the backend record, then `nyxid node credentials add` to store the credential locally on the node.
> Credentials can be added, updated, or removed while the agent is running. The agent watches the config file and reloads credentials automatically (no restart needed). This works for both native daemons and Docker containers (config is mounted as a volume).
> Docker containers use the file backend (AES-GCM encrypted) -- OS keychain is not available in containers.

### Managing the node service

```bash
# Background service lifecycle (launchd on macOS, systemd on Linux)
nyxid node daemon install                              # install as system service (auto-starts on login)
nyxid node daemon install --force                      # reinstall / update service config
nyxid node daemon start                                # start the service
nyxid node daemon stop                                 # stop the service
nyxid node daemon restart                              # restart (picks up config changes)
nyxid node daemon status                               # check if installed and running
nyxid node daemon logs                                 # show recent logs (last 50 lines)
nyxid node daemon logs --follow                        # tail logs in real time
nyxid node daemon uninstall                             # remove service (stops first)
```

### Managing nodes

```bash
# nyxid CLI (manage nodes from user side)
nyxid node list --output json                          # list nodes (includes IDs)
nyxid node show <ID_OR_NAME> --output json             # show node details + metrics
nyxid node register-token                              # interactive: opens browser wizard (v3.1)
nyxid node register-token --name "edge-tokyo" --output json  # scripted: prints raw nyx_nreg_... (legacy shape)
nyxid node delete <ID_OR_NAME> --yes                   # delete node
nyxid node rotate-token <ID_OR_NAME>                   # interactive: opens browser wizard (shows new auth_token + signing_secret)
nyxid node rotate-token <ID_OR_NAME> --output json     # scripted: prints raw secret to stdout (legacy shape)

# nyxid node CLI (run on the node machine)
nyxid node credentials setup --service <SLUG>          # auto-detect and setup (recommended)
nyxid node credentials add --service <SLUG> --header Authorization --secret-format bearer
nyxid node credentials add-oauth --service <SLUG> --from-catalog  # OAuth from node
nyxid node credentials list                            # list configured credentials
nyxid node credentials remove --service <SLUG>         # remove credential
```

> `credentials setup` works for **catalog services**: it auto-detects whether the service needs an API key, OAuth, or gateway URL, guides the user through the right flow, and auto-registers the service in the backend with the node's ID. For **custom endpoints**, use `nyxid service add --custom --via-node <node>` first, then `nyxid node credentials add`.

## SSH Remote Access

All SSH commands accept service ID, slug, or name (auto-resolves). SSH slugs are scoped per-user -- two users can each have an SSH service with the same slug without conflict. MCP SSH tools (`ssh_exec`, `ssh_list`) only see the caller's own services.

```bash
nyxid ssh exec <SERVICE> --principal ubuntu -- uptime
nyxid ssh exec <SERVICE> --principal ubuntu -- ls -la /var/log
nyxid ssh terminal <SERVICE>                           # auto-resolves principal
nyxid ssh terminal <SERVICE> --principal ubuntu
nyxid ssh issue-cert <SERVICE> --public-key-file ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub --principal ubuntu --certificate-file ~/.ssh/id_ed25519-cert.pub
nyxid ssh proxy <SERVICE>                              # ProxyCommand for OpenSSH

# List SSH services
nyxid service list --output json | jq '.keys[] | select(.service_type == "ssh")'
```

## Set Up Notifications and Approvals

NyxID can require your explicit approval before any AI agent accesses your services. To receive approval requests, set up at least one notification channel:

### Step 1: Set up a notification channel

**Option A: Link Telegram** (recommended for desktop users)

```bash
nyxid notification telegram-link
# Follow the instructions: send the code to the NyxID bot on Telegram
```

**Option B: Download the NyxID mobile app** (recommended for on-the-go approvals)

- **Download (iOS & Android):** https://nyxid.onelink.me/REzJ/dql9w8fx

The link auto-detects your platform. The mobile app sends push notifications for approval requests. Log in with your NyxID account and your device is registered automatically.

You can use both Telegram and the mobile app together for redundancy.

### Step 2: Enable approval protection

Approval protection is enabled automatically when you link Telegram or register a mobile device. You can also toggle it manually:

```bash
nyxid approval enable                                  # enable approval protection
nyxid approval disable                                 # disable (auto-approve all requests)
```

### Step 3: Check your notification settings

```bash
nyxid notification settings                            # show current notification & approval status
```

If the user has not set up any notification channel yet, **proactively suggest** they do so before making proxy requests. Walk them through the steps above.

### Approvals reference

Approvals default to **per-request** mode: every proxy call needs fresh approval. The approval notification includes a human-readable `action_description` (e.g., "POST /v1/chat/completions (model: gpt-4, 3 messages)"). Grant-based approval is opt-in via `--approval-mode grant`.

```bash
nyxid approval list --output json                      # list pending approvals (includes action_description)
nyxid approval show <ID>                               # show approval details + action_description
nyxid approval approve <ID>                            # approve a request
nyxid approval deny <ID>                               # deny a request
nyxid approval enable                                  # enable global approval protection
nyxid approval disable                                 # disable global approval protection
nyxid approval grants --output json                    # list active grants (grant mode only)
nyxid approval service-configs --output json           # list per-service approval configs (includes approval_mode)
nyxid approval set-config <SERVICE_ID> --require-approval true                    # per-request (default)
nyxid approval set-config <SERVICE_ID> --require-approval true --approval-mode grant  # grant mode

# `<SERVICE_ID>` is a UserService ID from `nyxid service list --output json`
# (recommended — works for both catalog-backed and custom user services) or
# a legacy catalog `DownstreamService.id`. Custom services (added via
# `nyxid service add --custom`) have no catalog backing, so the UserService
# ID is the only way to target their per-service policy.

# Org-level per-service approval policies (admin only). When set, the
# policy is dominant over the member's personal gate: every member of
# the org must get an admin's approval before the proxy call goes through.
nyxid approval service-configs --org <ORG_ID> --output json
nyxid approval set-config <SERVICE_ID> --org <ORG_ID> --require-approval true
nyxid approval set-config <SERVICE_ID> --org <ORG_ID> --require-approval true --approval-mode grant
nyxid approval list --org <ORG_ID> --output json       # list requests against org services

nyxid notification settings                            # show notification settings
nyxid notification update --approval-telegram true     # enable telegram notifications
nyxid notification update --approval-push true         # enable push notifications
nyxid notification telegram-link                       # link telegram account
```

## Bot-Capable Service Connections

NyxID treats messaging platform bots as standard service connections. The credentials live in the same place as any other service (encrypted, scoped, audited) and outbound bot API calls go through the regular `/api/v1/proxy/s/{slug}/{path}` proxy. Inbound webhook handling is the responsibility of the calling agent runtime (Aevatar, custom backend, etc.) -- NyxID does not own chat runtime.

```bash
# Telegram bot (path-injected token)
nyxid service add api-telegram-bot
# CLI prompts for the bot token (from @BotFather)

# Then call any Bot API method directly -- pass only the method name in the
# proxy path. NyxID prepends `bot<token>/` automatically, so the forwarded
# URL becomes https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/<method>.
nyxid proxy request api-telegram-bot sendMessage \
  -m POST -d '{"chat_id":12345,"text":"hello"}'

nyxid proxy request api-telegram-bot setWebhook \
  -m POST -d '{"url":"https://aevatar-host/api/channels/telegram/callback/abc"}'

nyxid proxy request api-telegram-bot getWebhookInfo -m POST -d '{}'

# IMPORTANT: do NOT include `/bot/` or `/bot{token}/` in the proxy path --
# NyxID adds it for you. `setWebhook` is correct; `bot/setWebhook` would
# forward as `bot<token>/bot/setWebhook` and Telegram returns 404.

# Lark bot (tenant token exchange is fully automatic)
nyxid service add api-lark-bot
# CLI prompts for app_id AND app_secret. NyxID stores both encrypted and
# handles the tenant_access_token exchange transparently on every call.
# After register, the CLI prints a `Configure Permissions:` block with a
# deep link into the Lark developer console's Permissions & Scopes page,
# scopes pre-selected from the catalog's `required_permissions`. The
# same link is surfaced by `nyxid service show api-lark-bot-<id>` and on
# the web UI key detail page. Use it instead of telling the user to
# search for scope keys manually.
# Just hit the Lark API path directly -- no manual token management:
nyxid proxy request api-lark-bot /open-apis/im/v1/chats -m GET

nyxid proxy request api-lark-bot /open-apis/im/v1/messages \
  -m POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
  -d '{"receive_id":"oc_xxx","msg_type":"text","content":"{\"text\":\"hello\"}"}'

# NyxID caches the tenant_access_token in-process (~2h TTL) and single-
# flights refreshes per app, so concurrent requests never produce
# duplicate exchanges. Your app_secret never leaves NyxID.

# Feishu bot (China region — same flow, same automatic token exchange)
nyxid service add api-feishu-bot

# Discord bot (Bot prefix in Authorization header, persistent token)
nyxid service add api-discord-bot
# CLI prompts for the bot token. Then call:
nyxid proxy request api-discord-bot /channels/{channel_id}/messages \
  -m POST -d '{"content":"hello"}'
# NyxID adds `Authorization: Bot <your_token>` automatically.

# Slack bot (persistent xoxb- token, standard Bearer auth)
nyxid service add api-slack-bot
# CLI prompts for the Bot User OAuth Token (xoxb-...) from your Slack app's
# OAuth & Permissions page. NyxID injects `Authorization: Bearer xoxb-...`
# on every outbound call.
nyxid proxy request api-slack-bot /chat.postMessage \
  -m POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
  -d '{"channel":"C1234567890","text":"hello"}'

nyxid proxy request api-slack-bot /conversations.list -m GET
```

### If Lark/Feishu bot calls fail, recreate the binding

If `nyxid proxy request api-lark-bot ...` (or `api-feishu-bot`) returns
errors like **"Missing access token for authorization"**, **"token_exchange
auth method requires token_exchange_config"**, or any `99991xxx` Lark
error that shouldn't happen given your setup, your binding is probably
stuck on the **old body-injection shape** from an earlier NyxID version.

**In both the old and new flows, your `app_secret` is stored encrypted
on NyxID and never leaves the server after registration.** The only
thing that changed is how NyxID uses it:

- **Old flow:** NyxID stored only `app_secret`. The *caller* had to
  explicitly hit `/open-apis/auth/v3/tenant_access_token/internal`; the
  proxy merged `app_secret` into that request body server-side, handed
  back a `tenant_access_token`, and the caller was then responsible for
  caching it and attaching `Authorization: Bearer ...` to every
  subsequent Lark call.
- **New flow:** NyxID stores `app_id` **and** `app_secret` together
  (JSON blob, same AES-256 encryption). NyxID calls the exchange
  endpoint itself server-to-server, caches the `tenant_access_token`
  in-process with single-flight dedup, and injects the Bearer header on
  every outbound Lark request. Callers just hit the real API path.

Older bindings only contain `app_secret` without `app_id`, so the new
transparent-exchange path can't use them. Fix by deleting the binding
and re-adding -- this prompts for both fields and stores them in the
new shape:

```bash
# List your bindings and find the stale one (grab its id)
nyxid service list --output json | jq '.keys[] | select(.slug == "api-lark-bot") | {id, label}'

# Delete it (replace <id> with the id from the previous command; --yes
# skips the confirmation prompt so this works in agent contexts)
nyxid service delete <id> --yes

# Re-add -- the new prompt asks for BOTH app_id and app_secret
nyxid service add api-lark-bot

# Verify the new binding works (should return chats, not a missing-token error)
nyxid proxy request api-lark-bot /open-apis/im/v1/chats -m GET
```

You're just re-registering the same secret you already gave NyxID the
first time -- it travels once from your terminal to NyxID over HTTPS,
gets re-encrypted at rest, and then stays there. The same recreation
steps apply to `api-feishu-bot`.

### Picking the right service for the job

| Slug | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `api-lark` | Lark API as a logged-in user (OAuth) |
| `api-lark-bot` | Lark API as a bot (automatic tenant token exchange) |
| `api-feishu` | Feishu API as a logged-in user (OAuth) |
| `api-feishu-bot` | Feishu API as a bot (automatic tenant token exchange) |
| `api-telegram-bot` | Telegram Bot API |
| `api-discord` | Discord API as a logged-in user (OAuth) |
| `api-discord-bot` | Discord API as a bot (persistent bot token) |
| `api-slack` | Slack Web API as a logged-in user (OAuth) |
| `api-slack-bot` | Slack Web API as a bot (persistent `xoxb-` token) |

## Channel Bot Relay

NyxID can bridge messaging platforms (Telegram, Discord, Lark, Feishu, Slack) to AI agent callback URLs. Users register their own bots, configure conversation-to-agent routing, and NyxID handles webhook reception, message normalization, and delivery to the agent.

NyxID is a **pure passthrough gateway** (ADR-013): it never stores message bodies or attachments. Only routing metadata lives in NyxID; the full conversation history belongs to the downstream agent.

### Register a bot

```bash
# Telegram
nyxid channel-bot register --platform telegram --label "My Support Bot" --token-env TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN

# Discord (requires public key for signature verification)
nyxid channel-bot register --platform discord --label "My Discord Bot" --token-env DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN --public-key "ed25519_public_key_hex"

# Lark (requires app credentials + verification token; optional encrypt key)
nyxid channel-bot register --platform lark --label "My Lark Bot" --token-env LARK_BOT_TOKEN --app-id "cli_xxx" --app-secret-env LARK_APP_SECRET --verification-token "vtoken_xxx" --encrypt-key "encrypt_key_xxx"

# Feishu (same flags as Lark)
nyxid channel-bot register --platform feishu --label "My Feishu Bot" --token-env FEISHU_BOT_TOKEN --app-id "cli_xxx" --app-secret-env FEISHU_APP_SECRET --verification-token "vtoken_xxx" --encrypt-key "encrypt_key_xxx"

# Slack (pass the xoxb- bot user token and the app's signing secret)
nyxid channel-bot register --platform slack --label "My Slack Bot" --token-env SLACK_BOT_TOKEN --app-secret-env SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET
```

For Telegram, NyxID auto-registers the webhook. For Discord/Lark/Feishu/Slack, configure the webhook URL in the platform's developer console: `https://<your-nyxid>/api/v1/webhooks/channel/<platform>/<bot-id>`. Telegram/Discord/Slack bots auto-activate on first successful webhook delivery. Lark/Feishu bots promote from `pending_webhook` to `active` only after inbound webhook verification passes, which requires the bot's Verification Token to be set correctly. Encrypt Key is optional, but if it is enabled in the Lark/Feishu console it must also be set on the bot. The CLI falls back to `NYXID_LARK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN` and `NYXID_LARK_ENCRYPT_KEY` when `--verification-token` or `--encrypt-key` are omitted. For Slack, paste the URL into the app's **Event Subscriptions** page — Slack's `url_verification` handshake is answered automatically.

**Lark/Feishu permission setup link (NyxID#167).** For Lark/Feishu bots, every response that includes the bot's `app_id` also carries a `permission_setup_url` and `permission_setup_scopes` field. The URL deep-links into the developer console's Permissions & Scopes page with the scopes NyxID's adapter needs (`im:message`, `im:message:send_as_bot`) already pre-checked, ready for "Bulk Enable". The CLI prints it as a `Configure Permissions:` block after `nyxid channel-bot register`, `nyxid channel-bot show`, and `nyxid channel-bot update` (table mode); the web UI renders it as a "Configure Permissions" section on the bot detail page. When helping a user set up a Lark/Feishu bot, point them at this link instead of asking them to manually search for scope keys in the developer console.

### Manage bots

```bash
nyxid channel-bot list                          # list registered bots
nyxid channel-bot show <ID>                     # bot details + conversation count
nyxid channel-bot update <ID> --label "New Label" --verification-token "vtoken_xxx" --encrypt-key "encrypt_key_xxx" --app-id "cli_xxx" --app-secret "secret_xxx"
nyxid channel-bot verify <ID>                   # re-verify token and webhook
nyxid channel-bot delete <ID> --yes             # deregister bot
```

### Fix a stuck Lark / Feishu bot

If an existing Lark / Feishu bot is stuck in `pending_webhook`, the owner should update the bot with the correct Verification Token and, if the Lark / Feishu console has encryption enabled, the matching Encrypt Key:

```bash
nyxid channel-bot update <ID> --verification-token "vtoken_xxx" --encrypt-key "encrypt_key_xxx"
```

The same fix is available in the web UI bot detail page, which uses `PATCH /api/v1/channel-bots/{id}` under the hood. After the next verified inbound webhook is received, NyxID auto-promotes the bot to `active`.

If the bot is also missing required scopes (a common parallel symptom), surface the `permission_setup_url` from `nyxid channel-bot show <ID>` — clicking it opens the developer console with NyxID's required scopes pre-selected so the owner can grant them in one click.

### Configure conversation routing

Each conversation route maps a platform chat to an AI agent (via API key with `callback_url`):

```bash
# Set up an API key with a callback URL first
nyxid api-key create --name "my-agent" --platform claude-code --callback-url "https://my-agent.example.com/webhook"

# Route all messages from a bot to this agent (default/catch-all)
nyxid channel-bot route create --bot <BOT_ID> --agent <API_KEY_ID_OR_NAME>

# Route a specific DM or group chat to a specific agent
nyxid channel-bot route create --bot <BOT_ID> --conversation-id "<chat_id>" --agent <API_KEY_ID_OR_NAME>

# Route a specific group chat with conversation type hint
nyxid channel-bot route create --bot <BOT_ID> --conversation-id "<group_chat_id>" --conversation-type group --agent <API_KEY_ID_OR_NAME>

# Per-user routing in a group (different agents for different users)
nyxid channel-bot route create --bot <BOT_ID> --conversation-id "<group_chat_id>" --sender-id "<user_id>" --agent <AGENT_A>
nyxid channel-bot route create --bot <BOT_ID> --conversation-id "<group_chat_id>" --sender-id "<user_id_2>" --agent <AGENT_B>

# List and manage routes
nyxid channel-bot route list --bot-id <BOT_ID>
nyxid channel-bot route update <ROUTE_ID> --agent <NEW_KEY>
nyxid channel-bot route delete <ROUTE_ID> --yes
```

Routing priority: sender-specific match > exact conversation match > default catch-all.

For Telegram, `conversation_id` is the `chat.id` (a number like `-1001234567890` for groups). For Discord, it's the `channel_id`. For Slack, it's the channel id (`C...` public channel, `G...` private group / mpim, `D...` direct message). The bot must be added to the group/channel on the platform side.

### How it works

1. User sends message on Telegram/Discord/Lark/Feishu/Slack
2. Platform webhook delivers to NyxID
3. NyxID verifies signature, resolves route, writes a metadata-only record (per ADR-013, no text or attachments are persisted)
4. NyxID POSTs the normalized payload to the agent's `callback_url` with an HMAC signature
5. **Agent must return 202.** Sync replies (200 + body) are no longer supported — any body on a 200 is silently discarded
6. Agent processes asynchronously, then POSTs the reply to `/channel-relay/reply`
7. NyxID delivers the reply to the platform chat

Slack specifics: inbound events land on `/api/v1/webhooks/channel/slack/{bot_id}` and are HMAC-verified against the app's signing secret (`v0:{ts}:{body}` with a 5-minute replay window). NyxID ACKs with HTTP 200 inside Slack's 3-second window and processes in a background task. Outbound replies go through `chat.postMessage`; threaded replies anchor on the thread root via `metadata.thread_ts`. Rate-limit signals (HTTP 429 with `Retry-After`, or `{"ok":false,"error":"ratelimited"}`) surface as a clearly-labeled error so the agent can decide when to retry.

The callback payload includes normalized fields (`content.text`, `sender`, etc.), the full `raw_platform_data` (original Telegram/Discord/Lark/Slack JSON), and a per-callback `reply_token` (RS256 JWT) the agent can use to post its async reply without holding the agent API key. The callback is the **only** place the message body exists inside NyxID — it's built in-memory from the live webhook parse and once the callback returns, NyxID retains nothing but metadata.

### Agent-facing endpoints

```bash
# Async reply — this is the only way for an agent to respond.
# Authorization: Bearer <agent API key> OR <reply_token from the callback payload>.
POST /api/v1/channel-relay/reply
{ "message_id": "<inbound-msg-id>", "reply": { "text": "..." } }

# Edit a previously-sent reply (Lark/Feishu only in v1).
# Addresses the upstream platform message returned by a prior /reply call
# (e.g. Lark `om_xxx`). Same dual auth as /reply.
POST /api/v1/channel-relay/reply/update
{ "message_id": "<upstream_platform_message_id>", "reply": { "text": "..." } }

# Message history (metadata only — `text` and `attachments` are NOT returned per ADR-013)
GET /api/v1/channel-relay/messages/<conversation_id>?page=1&per_page=50

# Resolve platform sender to NyxID user
GET /api/v1/channel-relay/resolve-sender?platform=telegram&platform_id=12345
```

#### Editing a sent reply (progressive / streaming renders)

`POST /channel-relay/reply/update` lets an agent PATCH the text of a reply it already sent, which is how you implement progressive / streaming reply rendering on Lark/Feishu without flooding the chat with one message per token chunk.

- **Body:** `{ "message_id": "<upstream_platform_message_id>", "reply": { "text": "...", "metadata": {...} } }`. `message_id` is the platform message id (e.g. Lark `om_xxx`) returned by the prior `/reply` call — **not** the inbound message id.
- **Auth:** Same as `/reply`: agent API key OR the original per-callback reply token. The reply token is reusable for edits — see the reply-token section below for the JTI semantics.
- **Platform support in v1:**
  - Lark / Feishu: text edits via `PUT /im/v1/messages/{id}`, card edits via `PATCH /im/v1/messages/{id}` (pass the new card in `reply.metadata.card`).
  - Telegram / Discord / Slack / OpenClaw: `501` with `code="edit_unsupported"`. Degrade to a final `/reply` at turn end.
  - Device channels: `400 device_channel_reply_not_allowed` (device conversations have no reply surface).
- **Throttling is the caller's job.** NyxID only protects against abuse — per-upstream-message rate limit (default `10/s` burst `20`, configurable via `CHANNEL_RELAY_EDIT_RATE_LIMIT_PER_SECOND` / `..._BURST`). `429 rate_limited` on exceed.
- **Error classification:** Lark frequency-limit errors surface as `429`; "message not editable / wrong state" errors as `409`; malformed content as `400`. Anything else falls through to `502`.

> **ADR-013 note:** `GET /channel-relay/messages/...` returns only routing metadata (direction, platform, sender ids, delivery status, timestamps). Agents that need conversation bodies must retain their own history.

#### Reply token (dual-auth on `/channel-relay/reply` and `/channel-relay/reply/update`)

The callback payload includes a short-lived `reply_token` (RS256 JWT) the agent can present as `Authorization: Bearer <reply_token>` instead of the agent API key. Intended for runtimes that don't want to persist agent credentials (e.g. Aevatar).

- **Shape:** RS256 JWT. `aud = "channel-relay/reply"` (rejected everywhere else). `token_type = "relay_reply"`.
- **Claim bindings:** `api_key_id`, `conversation_id`, `inbound_message_id`, `platform` — all four must match the reply request. For `/reply`, the body's `message_id` must equal `inbound_message_id`. For `/reply/update`, NyxID looks up the outbound row by the body's `message_id` (platform id) and verifies its stored `reply_to_message_id` equals the token's `inbound_message_id`.
- **TTL:** `JWT_RELAY_REPLY_TTL_SECS` (default `1800` = 30 min). 60s clock-skew tolerance on both `iat` and `exp`.
- **JTI semantics:** `jti` is consumed on the first successful `/reply`. Reuse on `/reply` returns `401 "Reply token already used"`. `/reply/update` uses the same token without consuming a new JTI — it requires the JTI to already exist in `reply_token_uses` (i.e. proof the token was used to send), so bare-minted tokens cannot edit-flood. The same token can therefore drive one send + many edits within the TTL.
- **Revocation coupling:** On every call NyxID re-checks that the bound `api_key_id` (and the channel bot) is still active — revoking the key invalidates all outstanding tokens immediately.
- **Null tokens:** If NyxID failed to mint a token, `reply_token` is `null` in the callback; fall back to the agent API key on the reply call.

Agents that already hold the API key can ignore `reply_token` entirely and keep using `Authorization: Bearer nyxid_ag_...`.

## HTTP Event Gateway — device/analyzer events

NyxID accepts push-mode events from external devices and analyzers on the same channel relay infrastructure. The envelope is converted to a `CallbackPayload` with `platform = "device"` and forwarded through the agent's `callback_url` just like a chat message.

Device channels are **first-class** and **not backed by a bot** — no Telegram/Discord/Lark/Feishu registration is required. A device channel is a `ChannelConversation` row with `platform = "device"` and `channel_bot_id = null`.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/channel-events/{conversation_id}`
**Auth:** Bearer API key (`nyxid_ag_...`) bound to the target conversation
**Storage:** Metadata only. Event payloads are never persisted (ADR-013).
**Retry:** None. NyxID is a pure passthrough — the client decides what to do on failure.
**Rate limit:** 100 events/second per conversation (default, configurable via `CHANNEL_EVENT_RATE_LIMIT_PER_SECOND`).
**Idempotency:** Best-effort — same `event_id` within 5 minutes is deduplicated.
**One-way:** Device conversations do not support agent replies. `POST /channel-relay/reply` returns `400 device_channel_reply_not_allowed` against a device channel.

### Create a device channel

Before pushing events, create a device channel (once) and bind it to an agent API key with a `callback_url`:

```bash
# Create the agent key first if you don't have one
nyxid api-key create --name "household-agent" --platform custom \
  --callback-url "https://my-agent.example.com/webhook"

# Create the device channel
nyxid channel-event channel create \
  --conversation-id household-camera \
  --agent-key-id <API_KEY_ID> \
  --conversation-type camera     # optional; defaults to "device"

# List device channels
nyxid channel-event channel list

# Delete a device channel (takes the NyxID-assigned _id, not the logical name)
nyxid channel-event channel delete <CONVERSATION_ROW_ID> --yes
```

You can also create the channel through `POST /api/v1/channel-conversations` directly:

```json
{
  "platform": "device",
  "platform_conversation_id": "household-camera",
  "agent_api_key_id": "<api-key-uuid>"
}
```

Validation rules for device channels:

- `channel_bot_id` MUST be omitted or null.
- `platform_conversation_id` is **required** and must be non-empty and not `"*"` (no catch-all routes).
- `platform_sender_id` and `default_agent: true` are rejected — devices have no group/sender or fan-out concept.
- Uniqueness is per `(user_id, platform_conversation_id)` — each owner gets one active device channel per logical name.

### Envelope

```json
{
  "event_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "source": "camera-analyzer",
  "type": "person_detected",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-08T12:00:00Z",
  "payload": { "room": "living_room", "confidence": 0.95 },
  "metadata": { "analyzer_version": "1.0" }
}
```

### Push events

The `conversation_id` in the path is the NyxID-assigned `_id` returned by `channel create` (not the logical `platform_conversation_id`).

```bash
# Push from the CLI
nyxid channel-event push \
  --conversation-id <CONVERSATION_ROW_ID> \
  --source camera-analyzer \
  --type person_detected \
  --payload-json '{"room":"living_room","confidence":0.95}'
```

```bash
# Push via curl
curl -X POST https://<your-nyxid>/api/v1/channel-events/<CONVERSATION_ROW_ID> \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer nyxid_ag_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "event_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "source": "camera-analyzer",
    "type": "person_detected",
    "timestamp": "2026-04-08T12:00:00Z",
    "payload": {"room": "living_room", "confidence": 0.95}
  }'
```

### Response codes

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 200 | Accepted (delivered) or deduplicated |
| 400 | Invalid envelope shape |
| 401 | Missing/invalid bearer, **or** conversation not found, **or** API key is not bound to the conversation (collapsed into one opaque error to prevent existence-probing) |
| 429 | Per-channel rate limit exceeded |
| 502 | Downstream agent unreachable or returned non-2xx |

## OpenClaw Integration

```bash
nyxid openclaw setup --url http://localhost:18789   # CLI prompts for token securely
```

**For OpenClaw users:** After installing or updating this skill, start a new chat to activate it. If the gateway isn't installed as a background service yet, set it up so it stays running and restarts automatically:

```bash
openclaw gateway status    # check if already running as a service
openclaw gateway install   # install as system service (systemd on Linux, launchd on macOS)
openclaw gateway start     # start the service
```

Without this, restarting the gateway (`openclaw gateway restart`) will shut it down and it won't come back up on its own.

**Transport selection.** `llm-openclaw` supports both HTTP proxy (`POST /v1/chat/completions`, etc.) and WebSocket passthrough (the OpenClaw CLI's native `connect` + `chat.send` flow). Check `nyxid proxy discover --output json` — the entry exposes `"streaming_supported": true` and `"websocket_supported": true`. Use `wss://<nyxid-host>/api/v1/proxy/s/llm-openclaw` with a `Bearer` token for the WebSocket path. If it's node-routed and the WS upgrade times out, update the node agent and restart its daemon (older agents pre-date WS proxy support).

**Scope and routing headers.** The service-level default-header flag closes the workflow described in NyxID#161 -- agents no longer need to remember `x-openclaw-scopes` per call. Set it once on the UserService and every call carries it automatically:

```bash
nyxid service update <user-service-id> --default-header 'x-openclaw-scopes=operator.read,operator.write'
```

## Account Management

```bash
nyxid whoami --output json                             # current user info
nyxid status --output json                             # full account overview
nyxid profile update --name "New Name"                 # update display name
nyxid mfa setup                                        # enable MFA (shows QR code)
nyxid mfa verify --code 123456                         # verify MFA setup
nyxid session list --output json                       # list active sessions
```

## Admin Operations

Commands under `nyxid admin` require the caller to have `is_admin=true` on their account. Non-admin callers get `1002 forbidden` from the server.

### Invite Codes

NyxID gates new-user registration behind invite codes. Each code grants a bounded number of registrations and can be deactivated at any time. Only admins can create or deactivate codes.

```bash
nyxid admin invite-code create                                    # default: 10 uses, no note
nyxid admin invite-code create --max-uses 5 --note "alice@corp"   # bounded uses + admin note
nyxid admin invite-code create --output json                      # machine-readable
nyxid admin invite-code list                                      # show all codes + usage
nyxid admin invite-code list --output json
nyxid admin invite-code deactivate <ID>                           # invalidate a code by ID
```

Notes for admins helping new users:

- `max-uses` must be between 1 and 1000. The default is 10.
- Codes look like `NYX-XXXXXXXX`. Share the code verbatim -- the CLI and frontend normalize casing/whitespace before hitting the server, so `nyx-abc123` and `NYX-ABC123` are treated the same.
- `list` shows `used_count/max_uses`, active state, and the per-redemption `usages` array (who used it, when).
- Deactivation is immediate and cannot be undone -- create a new code if the user needs another attempt.
- Create and deactivate are audited (`admin_invite_code_create`, `admin_invite_code_deactivate`) and visible in `nyxid` audit tooling.
- **Turning the gate off entirely:** set `INVITE_CODE_REQUIRED=false` in the backend environment and restart the server. Public registration then works without a code and first-time social sign-ups succeed normally. Set it back to `true` (or unset it) to re-enable the gate.


## MCP Configuration

```bash
nyxid mcp config --tool cursor                         # generate MCP config for Cursor
nyxid mcp config --tool claude-code                    # generate MCP config for Claude Code
nyxid mcp config --tool vscode                         # generate MCP config for VS Code
```

## Approval and Errors

- `7000 approval_required` -- user must approve the request; includes `action_description` and `request_id` (check `nyxid approval list`). Default mode is per-request (every call needs approval).
- `7001 approval_failed` -- approval was rejected, expired, or timed out. Response includes `request_id` and `approve_url` (a link to the web UI where the user can review pending approvals). If the user has no notification channel configured, suggest they set one up with `nyxid notification telegram-link` or by installing the mobile app.
- `1001 unauthorized` -- token/key invalid or expired (run `nyxid login` to re-authenticate)
- `1002 forbidden` -- missing scope or service not configured
- `8003 node_proxy_error` -- node agent proxy failed (check `nyxid node list`)
- **403 from downstream with no NyxID error code** -- the downstream service itself rejected the request. A common cause is WAF rules blocking your User-Agent header (e.g. `OpenAI/Python 2.30.0`). The user can set a per-service custom User-Agent override via the frontend (key detail page > Service > User-Agent) or via API: `PATCH /api/v1/user-services/{id}` with `{"custom_user_agent": "MyApp/1.0"}`. Set to `""` to clear and revert to passthrough.
- **Any other static header a downstream requires on every call** (scope hint, API version, routing key) should be configured once as a service default via `nyxid service update <id> --default-header 'name=value'` rather than sent from every caller.

## Working Rules

- Always discover services before assuming a slug exists.
- Use `--output json` for machine-readable responses.
- Prefer slug-based proxy URLs over UUID-based ones.
- Use exact downstream API paths. Do not guess undocumented endpoints.
- Keep request bodies minimal and service-correct.
- Never try to extract or display the user's stored provider credentials.
- If multiple AI agents share a machine, each should have its own `NYXID_ACCESS_TOKEN`. Never share a single API key across multiple agents -- it defeats audit isolation and makes revocation impossible without disrupting all agents.
- Your User-Agent header is forwarded to downstream services by default (passthrough). Some downstreams block SDK-specific User-Agent strings -- see the 403 troubleshooting note in "Approval and Errors" above.
- If a downstream requires a static header on every call (scope hint, API version, routing key), configure it once as a service default via `nyxid service update ... --default-header 'name=value'` rather than sending it from every caller.

## External Endpoints

All requests are made through the `nyxid` CLI, which connects to the NyxID instance configured at login. No other external endpoints are contacted. Downstream service calls are made server-side by NyxID.

## Security and Privacy

- **Credentials are protected.** For server-stored credentials, NyxID injects them server-side. For node-routed services, credentials never leave the user's node -- NyxID passes the request through and the node injects credentials locally.
- **Authentication tokens auto-refresh.** The CLI handles token refresh automatically.
- **No data is sent to third parties.** All traffic flows between the agent and the user's NyxID instance.
- **Audit logging.** All proxy requests are logged in NyxID for user review.

## Model Invocation Note

This skill may be invoked autonomously by the agent when a user request involves an external service. The agent discovers available services through NyxID and routes requests through the proxy without prompting for raw credentials. Users can disable this skill in their OpenClaw configuration to opt out.

## Trust Statement

By using this skill, requests are sent to your configured NyxID instance. NyxID forwards those requests to downstream services using your stored credentials. Only install this skill if you trust your NyxID instance operator.
